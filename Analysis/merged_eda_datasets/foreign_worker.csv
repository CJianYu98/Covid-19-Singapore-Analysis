"Our test rate is comparatively high, that's a good thing. 

At the same time I wonder how many of these tests were done on the general community vs the dorms and essential workers? I think this is the figure that better indicates if community spread is prevalent. 

520k people tested is a lot, but if I recall correctly we have more than 300k foreign workers living in dormitories and an unknown number outside. This demography probably made up a huge chunk of the 520k, what is leftover that is done for essential workers and the general community might not be a lot.",2020-07-16 10:15:21

"Only reason it's so high is because the govt ramped up testing at dorms once the dorm situation started.

People like to segregate daily cases and community cases into Dorms, PR/Citizens & Pass Holders, do the same with swab testing data and it will paint a clearer picture of what's happening.",2020-07-16 10:55:10

"That’s because shit hits the fan and there are too many dorm workers infected. Prior to that, our Govt didn’t eleven disclose the testing numbers. From Jan to Mid March, we refuse to disclose the testing numbers and they are probably in the region of a meagre few hundred a day. In fact, MoM threatened dorm owners who wanted to send their workers for testing in Feb. So yes we ramp up testing but that is because the dorms spread have become uncontrollable.",2020-07-16 13:09:39

"But where would the govt draw the line to who in the community should be tested? In comparison, the scale of testing needed for community would be way higher and the effectiveness may not offset that cost.",2020-07-16 10:55:53
"As a foreigner - and I may get downvoted for this - I just don't understand why Singaporeans like splitting hairs on every data point to find some form of supporting argument for their beliefs. In this case, it seems to be lack of testing. And the government doesn't help, with arbitrary divides for community spread and proactive testing and all that jazz. 

Tests are prioritized based on risk - for individual and the society as a whole. Can we not trust one of the best medical systems in the world to do that well?

Similar issues were raised in parliament when it came to jobs - I think Pritam asked how many went to Singaporeans and how many went to PRs when given a combined number. Maybe next he could ask how many went to PRs who did NS and those who didn't. For a society this small and this diverse, we could do with less division.",2020-07-16 10:52:35

"It was valid in the past when it mattered (the complaints are now months out of date). We had testing numbers in the very early days, and then they didn’t like the numbers being analysed, so they hid them for a while. Then, only a single vague figure was released (for which if you did some simple maths would find problematic). The regular figures came later after people gave up and stopped caring.

Similarly, they were open about case histories, until people made links about certain areas having disproportionately high numbers (which meant evidence of community spread), plus questions about some people having unusually high number of GP visits, and so they hid them.",2020-07-16 10:47:45

"Yes, very valid points. I think the easy answer to this is to look at how the other countries who have brought the situation under control are doing it. Especially those who are ahead of us in the curve. 

In my opinion, the tests and numbers only serve two purposes, to let us know if current measures are effective and to guide our next moves. However, these numbers only make sense for these purposes if the testing are done in the same manner as the other countries.",2020-07-16 12:08:14
"I support your opinion here. I think nitpicking exists because we (mostly) have our basic needs met thus issues picked out are beyond these basic needs. At times, this means scrutinising on a deeper level. However, I believe Pritam's question was legitimate because the availablity of PMET jobs for locals has been a point of contention in politics for nearly two decades. Retrenchments and job struggles which started as early as end of last year further magnified this problem. Personally, I think if you're an MP that has to constantly help citizens with job issues at Meet The People sessions but the government says 'Eh, more people employed what', you'd want to take a closer look at the numbers too. BUT, I understand your perspective. I lived overseas for a while and I was dumbfounded at times by some of their perspectives towards issues involving foreigners.",2020-07-16 11:25:47

"Not sure I understand you, but let me clarify. I don't disagree with how our government is prioritizing our limited testing capacity. But I do have doubts if our testing is representative and that has implications for our strategy moving forward. e.g Can we safely move to phase 3 and when? 

I don't know how Pritam got dragged into this and I don't wanna politicize this issue. It is uncalled for. However, since you brought it up, I might as well clarify with my take as well. 

I don't see Pritam's question as ""divisive"", that is something that people projected onto it. There is nothing wrong with PRs landing good jobs in SG, especially if they bring along skills that our economy requires, but that is not what the debate was about. The request for a breakdown was relevant in that context since the debate was about the impact on Singaporean employment prospects. How else do we track if policies aimed at helping Singaporeans remain relevant in the jobs market are working? Anyway, subsequent data release actually support the PAP's narrative.",2020-07-16 11:48:59
"Splitting hairs... in other words, complaining.

Not been here for long? If anything, Singaporeans are known for it’s complaining and queueing up for anything at all.

Your point on Pritam’s question though, I take issue with. It’s only natural to want to know how the government’s policies are affecting Singaporeans - the people who actually call this island home by virtue of having no other home. By engaging in sophistry and denying those numbers to us, the implication is that the numbers are somehow embarrassing for the government.",2020-07-16 13:28:20

"This is because you did not follow every step of the way like Singaporeans did and only take the propaganda AFTER they have stepped up testing. Prior to the dorm cases from Jan to March, suspected people were made to take 5 days MC and doctor jump before being tested. Despite the population pushing for test numbers, the testing numbers were hidden from the people when other countries were disclosing test numbers in Feb and March. It’s only after pressing from the people when the Govt disclose the test numbers 3 months later from the outbreak as a cumulative number. After the dorm case hit the fan, then we ramp up testing and only then they disclose the numbers. The news are always manipulated and unless people distill deeper, they always thought SG is gold standard. Even WHO declare SG as gold standard.

"I just took Pritam as an example because it was a very specific question on 'data' and 'breakdown'. Also, because I thought (in my humble opinion) that the question was kinda unwarranted. I think the government has gone above and beyond to safeguard jobs for Singaporeans, and that question was kinda a low blow. And I am glad the data agreed with it - and honestly I feel that's how it would be with this question on the testing numbers too.",2020-07-16 18:35:11
"I love Pritam (no homo), but he knew he was putting the government (CCS no less) in a spot. Having a split on those numbers would require government to change its employment policies across the board to prioritize Singaporeans over PR instead of the current level field. And if I am not wrong, that's something LKY wanted to avoid because he saw PRs (or at least their kids) as future Singaporeans and distinctions would aversely affect the rate of integration.

"To add to this: no other population in the world (AFAIK) has had the level of testing that Singapore's migrant worker population had.

Singapore's migrant workers stay in dormitories, separate from the wider population. When the virus broke out among them, they were forced to stay in the dormitories (effectively, imprisoned) until 100% of them had been tested for the virus. This allowed the government to detect 100% of asymptomatic cases in that population (except for any false negatives) which normally go undetected in any other population - which would inflate the lethality statistic of the virus in other populations. No other population on earth of equivalent size, that I'm aware of, has been 100% quarantined and tested like this, which is another reason why the virus has higher reported rates of death amongst other populations (undetected asymptomatic cases.)",2021-02-11 07:27:04

I admit that the morality of voting is quite murky. Some cases are very clear, (like if you voted for Hitler to come into power). But other cases like this are less clear because the power to control policy through voting is very limited, but not totally useless. In that sense I disagree that we, as a society, are totally blameless. We do, and must, shoulder some blame.

You do realize that the issue we're debating on is about their vulnerability towards pandemics, which wouldn't be a thing if their living quarters aren't pitiful. Why do you think most of us are still surviving the virus? Because we're capable of making ourselves less vulnerable. Imagine trying to be semi-immune in a flat filled with cockroaches with floors caked in urine.


Are you trying to tell me that the government is capable of wielding their power for good? Actually, yes. On the other hand, given how quickly they changed their tune after a bunch of people angrily pushed back, they can definitely use it for the greater good. In terms of land, if they can greenlight estates of unnecessary condos in tiny spaces, they could have also used the same land to build dorms for foreign workers. I live near a large patch of deserted land that could have been used to build a long stretch of dorms. It's convenient for the workers too. Been here for a decade and nothing's been done to it. Hence, I disagree with the notion that we do not have sufficient land — we do, the big G's simply unwilling to use it if it's not gonna make them money.",2020-04-10 10:28:58

I digress.


In regards to the situation at hand, you must have missed the deplorable comments about how the workers are at fault for ""not knowing how to eat off the ground"" and ""having poor hygiene standards in the first place"". No one was born with the knowledge of good hygiene, but we were all *educated* on the practice. Thus, they could have been educated as well. But no, they're just animals to some apparently. One comment I read even suggested that help shouldn't be rendered to them because they'll ""revert to their terrible hygiene standards"". And that's just one idiot who dared to vocalize such thoughts. What makes you think no one else thinks the same way?


As I mentioned in a previous post, humans seem to derive sick pleasure from treating their perceived inferiors as non-humans. Not just migrant workers but domestic helpers too. So, yes, each of our respective actions will shape the world it is today. You're a taxpayer and if you're demanding for a change while paying your taxes, why won't the government listen since they essentially depend on you to grow the economy and their pockets?

It's estimated there's at least 100,000 people in the UK that are essentially held as slaves - more than half of them migrants.  Anti-slavery charities argue that despite stricter laws, especially the Modern Slavery Act 2015, the government still isn't doing enough.  This is only one example of how migrant workers, or workers in general, can be mistreated in the UK. (Links below)

It's 13% and 5% for EU workers, compared to 4% and 2% for UK-born residents.](https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/migrants-and-housing-in-the-uk-experiences-and-impacts/)  [Another link](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-cambridgeshire-22707084/migrant-workers-action-to-beat-landlord-exploitation)

These are predominantly migrant workers.]( https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/uk-report-uncovers-textile-workers-earning-less-than-half-minimum-wage)

I'm not trying to argue that the state of affairs in the UK is worse than in Singapore.  What I am arguing is that the treatment of migrant workers is poor across the globe, even in countries deemed to be firmly ""first world"".  Of course Singapore can do better, and Singapore should do better, but the west isn't always a workers' heaven, either.

EDIT: and it's also naive to assume there's no modern-day slaves in Singapore, but again - that's a problem globally.

In a country of 66 million people. That is why it is so hard to enforce, because the numbers are incredibly small compared to  the total number of people. It is tragic but it is done in very small scale for a country the size of the UK. And if you get caught, you will go to jail. 
Here it is institutionalized, done everywhere, in bright daylight and everyone knows who does it and where it is done. It is a conscious decision from the authorities not to enforce it.

"But it's not that different - in the UK, the authorities know how most of these people are trafficked and their destinations (nail salons being a particularly popular destination for slave labour, as is construction and sex work).  This isn't just an authorities thing, this is well-publicised information, and lots of people will know that if their nail salon worker is Vietnamese, they've probably been trafficked.  Little action has been taken.

For what it's worth, it's estimated that there's 9,000 slaves in Singapore, which makes up a similar proportion of the population to the UK.

General attitudes may be poor in Singapore, and probably worse than in the UK, but as someone who has lived in the UK for four years at this point, it's hard to say that British people have positive attitudes towards migrant workers and their place in society.  There's a reason why Brexit happened, after all.

All I'm saying is that mistreatment of foreign workers is widespread and not restricted to Singapore and oil monarchies in the Gulf (and comparison between Singapore and the Gulf states really underplays the extent of the problem in the Gulf, but that's another argument).",2020-04-09 20:44:22

It really doesn't make sense to me that Indonesia has fewer cases but 60x more deaths. At the end of the day the accuracy of the number of confirmed cases for such a contagious disease will be extremely inaccurate, and the only real purpose that testing serves is to identify clusters and contain the virus. Numbers are just statistics (and number of cases is an inaccurate one in this pandemic) at the end of the day, and there are more accurate statistics like number of deaths as I had mentioned.",2020-04-28 12:11:25

"Shekor arrived in Singapore a decade ago at age 17, one of many low-income migrant workers who have powered the city’s growth, building hospitals, subway lines and the Marina Bay Sands resort.

In his years working in aluminum production and on construction sites, the Bangladeshi national has suffered various work-related injuries. The most recent, on March 18, left him with searing pain in his left hip.

That was also the date that coronavirus infections in the city-state — whose early response epidemiologists had lauded as the gold standard — began soaring, from 313 then to more than 9,000 as of Tuesday, after two days of record jumps.


Almost 70 percent of Singapore's coronavirus cases are concentrated in migrant dormitories.

Singapore's migrant workers face a heightened risk of infection because of overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.
Thousands of new cases — and almost 70 percent of Singapore’s total — are concentrated in dormitories that house migrant workers, who have been locked down in their quarters as authorities seek a solution. For Shekor, who gave only his first name for fear of retribution from his employer, it means no access to painkillers he needs just to sleep.

“Everything is so difficult for everybody here,” he said in a phone interview from his dormitory of 25,000, where hundreds have been infected. “It seems like they only take the most serious ones to hospital; the normal ones like me, no one takes care of us.”


The situation highlights the vulnerability of migrant workers, who in Singapore make up one-third of the labor force. Their risks of infection are exacerbated by overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.

 A construction site in Singapore lies empty on April 11 during a halt to nonessential work to stem the spike in coronavirus cases.
In the Persian Gulf, laborers’ quarters also have become infection hotspots. As in Singapore, many migrant laborers are from South Asia. Elsewhere, African migrants in China are facing discrimination and xenophobia, refused entry into restaurants or evicted from their homes. Singapore’s largest Chinese-language broadsheet, Lianhe Zaobao, recently published a letter from a reader who blamed the migrants for the outbreaks, labeling their countries “backward” and their practices dirty.

In Singapore, critics say these events have revealed a hubris among the authorities and the wider community, who took for granted their initial success in keeping infection numbers low while failing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak among the most downtrodden.


A worker on a dormitory balcony.

Workers hang out in a dormitory compound. About a dozen compounds have been put on quarantine, which means workers are confined to their rooms.
“For the first two months, we engaged in a lot of self-congratulation,” said Alex Au, vice president of rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). “If anyone had cared to look, the dangers were already there.”

Authorities had planned for the epidemic with a focus only on citizens, he said, distributing surgical masks, hand sanitizer and reusable masks only to Singaporean households. Singaporean residents returning from the United States and Britain, meanwhile, were put up in four- and five-star hotels paid for by the government.

“This reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don’t exist,” Au said.

 A volunteer at the Migrant Workers Center helps organize bottles of hand sanitizer that will be distributed to the workers.
HealthServe, a nonprofit providing subsidized health care to migrant workers, said migrants had been anxious as early as February about the virus and their level of risk in overcrowded living conditions. But a change in regulations meant volunteer doctors and nurses staffing the organization’s nonprofit clinics could no longer serve part-time, forcing it to cut services by 90 percent.

“This was a situation we felt was going to come, even if we were hoping for the best,” said Suwen Low, spokeswoman for HealthServe.

A spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post with a news release, issued April 14, saying that authorities are working to “reduce the number of workers in the dormitories and also implement a medical support plan at all dormitories.”


Workers in essential services have been moved out of dormitories, the ministry said, while officials were identifying alternative accommodations for others, such as army camps, sports halls, vacant housing blocks and shipping containers.

“Our immediate priority for the workers in the dormitories is to help them stay healthy and minimize the number that get infected,” said Josephine Teo, Singapore’s manpower minister, in a news conference last week.

In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong began by noting that the number of new cases in the local community has leveled off before acknowledging the problematic sharp rise in total cases overwhelmingly among migrants.

“We will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans,” he said. “We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.”


HealthServe volunteers prepare to attend to patients at a clinic. The organization provides low-cost medical services to migrant workers.

Authorities are also working with organizations such as the Migrant Workers Center, which has a program of “ambassadors” who are helping their colleagues and friends understand hygiene practices, social distancing and practicalities like how to send remittances online. Yeo Guat Kwang, the group’s chairman, said the focus should be on improving conditions in the future.

“In hindsight, everyone would be wiser,” Yeo said. “But this is really an unprecedented global pandemic.”

A second wave of coronavirus infections began taking root in Singapore in mid-March, similar to other places in Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan, as residents abroad flocked back to the region when outbreaks intensified in Europe and the United States. But while Hong Kong managed this spike, getting new cases down to single-digits for more than eight days straight, and Taiwan recorded several days this month with no new cases, Singapore now has among the highest number of cases per capita globally.

The migrant workers bearing the brunt of the outbreak are overwhelmingly male and employed in construction and other labor-intensive sectors that Singaporeans avoid. The typical construction worker in Singapore earns about $430 a month, while the median monthly income for Singaporeans is $3,227.

 This field is usually crowded with migrant workers enjoying a day off.
“To keep them cheap, we have to exploit,” said Au from TWC2. “We pack them into [trucks], we pack them into dormitories, and now, when a crisis hits, they have no buffer.”

Clusters have been identified in many dormitories. More than a dozen dormitories have been placed under quarantine, meaning workers cannot leave their rooms, while nearly all dormitory residents are now barred from leaving the facilities, which are guarded by police.

The more than 200,000 dormitory residents are now anxious, bored, isolated and scared. Unable to buy their own groceries, cook for themselves or purchase phone cards to call home, they are almost completely dependent on charity and handouts.

A worker in one of the worst-hit dormitories, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Ali, was treated for a sore throat and fever before the lockdown, and placed on sick leave until April 9. He was given an “advisory for patients with respiratory tract infection” — a status that means he has to isolate himself from others or be fined $7,000.

That was impossible in his 12-person room, he said. Ali’s cough persisted, but under lockdown, he was unable to seek medical attention for several days.

“Who will give me any treatment or help?” he said in an interview. “I am so scared I will die before any help comes.”


Authorities say that infected dormitory residents have been linked through common work sites, and through places like shopping malls, where many gather on their days off. In the dormitories, before the lockdown, men were able to socialize with each other and cook together, a distraction from their physically demanding jobs and the difficulty of being away from their families.

In an interview Thursday, Ali said he was finally able to see a doctor, who gave him cough syrup and tested him for the coronavirus. He has not heard back. His 11 roommates are trying to keep their distance from each other, but find it near impossible. On a trip to the bathroom on Thursday evening, he found that there was no hand soap.

"So much of the world mainstream media seems to be framing the story as Singapore losing control of the virus. I may dislike the current lockdown measures, but it's clear that the media's narrative is simply untrue.

The reality is that what we know as community spread doesn't include the dorm-based foreign worker population as the government's measures effectively isolates them from what we see as the community around us. If they addressed the foreign worker situation in its own op-ed, yeah by all means. But to say that the country has lost control of the outbreak while the daily community spread total doesn't even reach triple digits is just incorrect.

"I would largely disagree. The method of stratifying ""community spread"" and ""dorm"" is very arbitrary.

For example, parallel our way of stratification with other politicians that likes to stratify between old and young. Some republicans will claim that Trump has the virus under control because when you stratify it by age, it will seem like they have it under control, because while death rates amongst the old are very high while death rates amongst the young are negligible. They can say, ""see, if you ignore the old, our statistics look great!"" Would that be correct? Because that's essentially what you're saying, ""if we ignore the dorms, our statistics look great!""

When you talk about whether a country has it under control, you should really include everyone who the government is **responsible** for. Our government is responsible for everyone no matter where they live. HDB, condo, landed, dorms. Just because we don't interact with foreign workers, doesn't mean government is not responsible for them. 

Furthermore, its damn arbitrary as to how we define ""community"". Govt could have stratified it any other way, they could have excluded prisons, they could have excluded old folk's home, they could have even excluded people living in Yishun. They could then quarantine these groups in their homes and say ""they are not in our community, so no community spread, therefore we have in under control"".

I shudder to think what would have happened if we were an inclusive society and mingled with these heroes who built our infrastructure.

We should encourage more discrimination, it protects us!",2020-04-23 00:40:42

"I think mothership has covered a story about workers being locked up? And there are some groups/politicians that have spoken up about the issues I believe. 

I think it is the 12-16 individuals in a room + the general attitude towards foreign workers that needs to be discussed.

I do think the measures and increased testing is a good sign though. Just many on the ground are wondering if testing could be scaled up and if the conditions above had been resolved, would it have led to a better outcome?",2020-04-22 22:18:48

"I don't disagree with your argument entirely, since there's truth to everything. I agree it would be much harder to quantify if govt had excluded a particular region rather than just a particular group. I also agree that the government is responsible for the foreign workers living in dorms contracting the virus due to inferior living conditions, there's no two ways about that.

That said, it is just how the situation with migrant workers has been handled by the government that, for the time being, effectively prevents them from mingling with the wider society outside of their dorms or isolation facilities. During this time they're pretty much unable to mingle with the rest of us, which is very unfortunate, but doing so has clearly brought cases outside of the dormitory down to low double digit numbers. I'm just saying that the situation isn't as overblown as the headline makes it out to be.

Hence, I feel the virus is still very much under control, and it will probably remain so as more migrant workers continue to be tested. One can only hope that this blows over quickly and they are allowed to return to the wider society soon, and that the government takes ownership of the dormitory problem and gets it resolved sooner.",2020-04-23 01:10:10
"If you ask me, no. I think the coronavirus was handled well though, that's why I think WaPo should either focus their article on the migrant worker situation entirely without bringing up the coronavirus, or write a different article about it and use this article to criticize our coronavirus management (which I'm certain WaPo can't because they don't have other arguments).",2020-04-23 01:41:49
"When did I say discrimination is a good thing?

To clarify, all I'm saying is the government has effectively isolated them by keeping them in their dormitories, or sending them to floating hotels, SAF camps, or the isolation centers across the island.

I didn't say don't count them as part of our total. I said we have to contextualize the numbers. WaPo could've framed this as a critical piece on migrant worker conditions in Singapore, why did they have to mention that Singapore lost control of the coronavirus in the title?

"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins.

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

"Nice opinion, but this is literally a slap on the wrist. For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",2020-04-14 00:46:43

This is a fundamental issue of governance - these companies operated within the law (largely, I'm sure there are some that do not), therefore the problem does not lie with them, it lies with the executive branch that sets the law and the population that elects them and/or does not demand changes to this law.

TL;DR - take a look in the mirror before chucking blame at someone else.",2020-04-14 10:03:27

If the companies were doing as per the law, cant blame them. Anyways, I am sure there will be medical insurances to cover for testing and treatment.

Further, companies should be liable to pay for food and basic recharge which I think they are as per the news report.

So, I think the comment is bit uninformed as the systems already are there to pay for most if not all costs said above. Very few of that costs will be coming to the tax payer.",2020-04-14 10:01:46

"Unpopular opinion: nothing will happen to the dorm owners and it is not their fault

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee? Our hdb and condo will be 3-4x more and nobody will be able to afford it. In other countries, bricklayers can be paid 5k a month. Will Singaporeans do it for 5k a month? The answer is no.",2020-04-14 11:06:47

"For a short term solution, yes you are right. However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

"Its kind of hard to just push the blame to dormitory operators (DO) though. It's easy to say that the company could've provided solution. But solution cost money and who's footing the bill.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

As a government, they would have maintained a reserve for this and should have been ready any day for a disaster like these.

"Thanks for this reply. Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",2020-04-14 10:13:57

"Foreign worker dormitory is basically BMT army dormitory. A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",2020-04-14 06:27:50

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",2020-04-14 06:27:50

The size is fixed by the MOM guidelines of certain sqft per pax. Not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation. For the maintenance, I know and I've seen how sloppy it can get. On facilities and all. Yes, I think they should be subjected to fines for that.

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition. 

In the right time living next to a volcano provide fertile land, in the wrong time living next to a volcano is a death trap.

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition. 

In the right time living next to a volcano provide fertile land, in the wrong time living next to a volcano is a death trap. You are being straight up ignorant if you believe that we are bringing foreign workers here to suffer and die. What kind of logic are you parading about here? You are the exact problem I am pinpointing. You parade about a moral highground with being woefully ignorant about the reality of the situation. What good exactly are you doing here?

No, math is not so important that if you don't know math people should die.

Math is important because if you don't understand the math you cant even being to comprehend the issue at hand and save a single person.

Yeah, you deserve to be downvoted for this comment. Damn you piss me off.",2020-04-14 15:41:57

"1) Bringing in 10 foreign workers using a hammer is just disingenuous to the work they are doing. Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

3) You don't need to solve the problem, but unless you actually tried to tackle the problem you don't understand why this is a problem that's so damned hard to solve. Logistic is everything. Your ""maybe"" doesn't actually do anything. What is to say that they won't just make things unnecessarily harder on FW?

"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure.

Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins.

"Nice opinion, but this is literally a slap on the wrist. For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",2020-04-14 00:46:43

"I'm with you in that, I really REALLY hope the companies running the dormitories get fined MASSIVELY after this is over. Their oversight, complacency and greed caused this, they should be penalized, more than the usual wrist-slapping over the last decade.

About taxpayers' money being spent to treat the foreign workers, I think it's still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did NOT intervene.

The last few weeks have shown that, no amount of appeals to common good is working... people just don't give a shit. Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

In a pandemic crisis where time is critical, government intervention is the only way, imho

"You also need to consider that checks were done by government agencies to clear these to be ""fit to live"" in.

Minister of State & Manpower stated 
> Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

"Unpopular opinion: nothing will happen to the dorm owners and it is not their fault

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee? Our hdb and condo will be 3-4x more and nobody will be able to afford it. In other countries, bricklayers can be paid 5k a month. Will Singaporeans do it for 5k a month?

"For a short term solution, yes you are right. However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

The foreign workers and their contributions have been immense to our nation building. However this is a flipside to think about as well.",2020-04-14 01:41:47

"Its kind of hard to just push the blame to dormitory operators (DO) though. It's easy to say that the company could've provided solution. But solution cost money and who's footing the bill.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

I think that this is an issue that isn't as simple as you think it is honestly.",2020-04-14 14:02:09

"Thanks for this reply. Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",2020-04-14 10:13:57

"Foreign worker dormitory is basically BMT army dormitory. A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",2020-04-14 06:27:50

"Hey, thanks for the reply and I get your frustrations because that's what I have been trying to reply to comments here. 

I don't have issues with the size per room. I have stayed before. But I do with two things, the maintenance and the size of dorm.

The size is fixed by the MOM guidelines of certain sqft per pax. Not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation. For the maintenance, I know and I've seen how sloppy it can get. On facilities and all. Yes, I think they should be subjected to fines for that.

Size of dorm, now this will fall under regulations which have to be changed to restrict mega dorms from happening again.",2020-04-14 07:50:16

"I agree with you. Singaporeans demand for a distinction between locals and foreigners. Otherwise, why have a citizenship? Also, these dorms are not the best, because these workers are meant to be transient. 

What is required is basic standards to be met. They are not living in inhuman/ cruel conditions. Their basic needs are met. Emphasis is on ""basic"" - nothing more. 

Seen the pictures of MOM approved dorms online. Yes, some dorms are a bit messy and look cluttered; but area wise, it is comparable to our NS dormitories. 

IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers? The complaint, rather should be - maybe we should be making the dorm operators enforce some level of discipline. Maybe more ""stand by area"" and ""area cleaning"". Or hire more cleaners.

Don't forgot that if you actually read the regulations, you will see that it is mandated by law for every dorm to have common areas for recreation; rooms to hang their clothes; sick bays and even wifi. So if they choose not to hang their clothes in the common area - that is in breach of regulations.",2020-04-14 12:56:57

"I don't think you're being creative enough with your solutions. 

1. Do we need that many foreign workers in the first place? We know that our construction companies are very low-tech when compared to developed nations because foreign labour here is still considered way too cheap. Why buy a bulldozer when I can hire 10 FWs to do the same job with hammers? Even the govt has been trying to persuade these companies to tech-up with no result. So there is still space to reduce the number of workers while still maintaining the same output. 
2. Do we really lack space? Some of the bosses of these dorms own a couple of landed properties for themselves both in and out of Sentosa. Maybe its time to consider a more utilitarian approach to the use of our land. If we are so land-scarce as you say, then why allow people to own more property than they need? 
3. Lastly, why must the solution fall on us? Govt sets the law and the market should be left with its own devices to come up with solutions. That is the beauty of capitalism.

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

"> # Singapore reports first likely COVID-19 re-infection after Bangladeshi dorm resident tests positive again

> SINGAPORE: A resident of a migrant worker dormitory has become Singapore’s first likely case of COVID-19 re-infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Feb 6).

> 

> The case is a 28-year-old Bangladeshi work permit holder who lives in a dormitory at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> He was confirmed to have the coronavirus on Apr 12 last year, and on Jan 25 this year, he tested positive again.

> ""He was identified from rostered monitoring testing conducted as part of MOH’s surveillance of recovered workers to monitor their postinfection immunity,"" said the ministry.

> When the man was confirmed to have had COVID-19 last year, he was identified as Case 2513 and was part of the cluster of infections at Tech Park Crescent dormitory, which is located at 43 Tech Park Crescent.

> He recovered from that infection and tested negative for COVID-19 from last June onwards.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> However, the man tested positive for COVID-19 once again on Jan 25 this year and he was isolated. ""Numerous repeat tests conducted subsequently were also positive for the virus,"" said MOH on Saturday.

> 

> The man's new infection was not previously stated in the ministry's situation reports. CNA has sought further information from MOH.

> 

> In its press release on Saturday, MOH said the man reported feeling unwell on Jan 22 and 23, but was otherwise asymptomatic.

> Advertisement

> He is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and all his identified close contacts have been isolated and quarantined. None have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.

> 

> “While re-infection is rare, the expert panel, which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts from NCID, Singapore General Hospital and the National Public Health Laboratory, has assessed that the clinical and laboratory evidence suggests that this is a likely case of re-infection,” MOH said.

> “In addition to his positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results, there was a corresponding marked increase in antibody titres compared to the period prior to the likely re-infection, suggesting that he was exposed to a new infection which boosted his antibody levels.

> “The virus detected in his samples taken in January 2021 is also genetically distinct from that associated with the dormitories outbreak in 2020, suggesting that this is likely a different and new infection.”

> 

> MOH said it will continue to monitor recovered COVID-19 cases to determine their post-infection immunity. No significant loss of post-infection immunity has been detected among recovered workers in dormitories so far.

We don't know for sure that's possible, and it'll depend on how long immunity lasts, but it is one possible outcome. 

This is related to why many native populations are so much more susceptible to severe disease even from things like flu. Basically, the reason why many diseases are as mild as they are is simply because our bodies have encountered them (or the antigens) before, either from vaccination or from childhood disease!

This combined with the uneven duration of the virus's incubation period (virus might not be active only after 14 days, might be earlier or later), plus the inaccuracies of swabbing (due to inadequate training for swabbers, and innately the test kit precision) would always lead to cases leaking through.

All I'm saying is that we shouldn't be surprised with one or 2 cases popping up within the community or the dorms. Nor should we be overly concerned. Not sure if the purpose of my original comment was misunderstood. 

Calm down people, I support whatever the Government is doing. The real heroes really are our frontline workers and public officer.",2020-12-16 15:48:50

The data does not support this as being the case. There will be the odd case currently but nothing currently supports that there are a sizable Number of unknown cases out there. There would be a lot more ;

a) community cases picked up and 
b) more than 25 people in hospital.

"I work nearby to the Westlite and Toh Guan Dorms. 

After the initial reports of Westlite having covid cases, I saw they were still open and operating as usual, even all the food stalls and the provision shop there. I was rather surprised they didn't try to isolate the situation earlier. 

I understand that maybe they couldn't just put everyone there under SHN immediately because of the financial implications, but I did wonder why they still allowed the workers to still congregate at the eating place and they also allowed the provision shop stay open. I didn't see any sanitizing stuff going on myself, but to be fair I have been telecommuting for most of the week so they may have done it without me seeing it.

The dorm owners should be held responsible, they should be the ones taking direct action, the government is an indirect force. But it seems like the article brushes this under the rug with a “how much can they do without the government saying something”. Which another poster who lived next to the dorms in said cluster said that they didn’t notice _any_ action taken until shit hits the fan. Why aren’t we holding our pitch forks to the dorm operators? Sure the issue of overcrowding is there, not ignoring that. That’s something the government should look at. But in the context of COVID, it’s not fair to shift the blame solely on the government.

Edit 2: from my reply below:

> the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  

Well, the notice just came up today, the blocks were being refitted with basic amenities like lighting and bedding, and it’s to house the foreign workers from the dorms so that they won’t be so cramped up together. They’ve been physically working at this for at least 2 weeks, you can only imagine the logistics and planning that needed to make this happen to go further back beyond that. 

See? I told you, they government _was_ doing something but as usual they do it quietly and don’t announce it until things are more or less underway - it’s their usual practice but as usual we only react to what we know because it’s soooo much easier to stand from where we are after everything has happened and criticize every single bit they’ve done than try to understand their plans. 

Edit: Okay, I get it. The signs have been there. But in crisis mode, to the benefit of the govt there’s many other areas they need to look at too. It wouldn’t be fair to say the government didn’t do anything when they have been doing everything they can for the whole country. And to pin the blame on them because a hotspot broke out in the dorms, isnt it speaking from hindsight?",2020-04-06 14:18:10

If they feel unwell, they are probably also much more likely to sound out early as it won't affect their employment.

Beyond that, its simply a matter of luck. In an alternative timeline, an asymptomatic carrier could have easily spread to his bunk mates forming a SAF cluster.",2020-04-06 17:14:28

There are a lot of worker dorms in Tuas cos of the shipyards and I really hope the virus won’t spread in there. Even before the circuit breaker measures, on any Sunday night, once you go all the way into Tuas, you’ll just see endless numbers of workers, most of whom will be lounging seated or lying down on the pavements using their phones. Imagine how cramped and stuffy their rooms are for them to prefer to lie down on the roadside pavements. 

(Source: I went in there before to distribute crowdsourced Christmas gifts as part of an initiative by ItsRainingRaincoats :))

From tomorrow onwards, with many of their work sites stopping work, it may possibly be the same scene all day every day. Hopefully it won’t be so crowded that even outside in the open air will put them at risk, especially since most of them aren’t provided masks.

"The dorm operators are there for profit. They will stick as many men in a room as the law allows. They will try to get away with not fixing shit when it breaks.

Fact is living in the dorms is cheaper than whatever else you can rent outside.",2020-04-06 21:58:35
"Simplest explanation is that you don't punish a Tiger for biting a human. It's just in its nature to do so. We expect corporations to be profiteering and cutting corners whenever they can. We know that is how they behave. 

But that is why we have governments and laws. Governments job is to constrain corporations from doing bad things while allowing profits to flow. What can we people do? We have no power to riot or protest, government took those away from us. The only player here with any real power to constrain these companies is the government, not us. You literally cannot hold your pitchfork outside these dorms, you will go to jail for protesting. 

Additionally we have warned the Government many times that this has been happening. As an analogy, imagine if a murderer is running rampant in your neighbourhood. After the first murder, you can say its the murderer's fault. So you complain to the police to ask him to get caught. But the police does nothing. After the 5th or 6th murder, the neighbourhood would be faulting the police too right? And then you come along and tell your neighbours ""why are you blaming the police but dont  blame the murderer""? What can your neighbours do? 

First time it happens, can say its the dorm operators. But please la, we've known about this overcrowding and unhygienic problem for donkey years and have complained to MOM. They dont do anything about it.",2020-04-06 22:50:10
"Yes definitely the dorm operators are the ones at fault for not doing proper upkeep of the premises. But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning. Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens. Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

The rise of the external dorm operators came about after the new ruling, I believe.",2020-04-06 22:27:45
"Issues were highlighted earlier though.  So it's might be considered more foresight than hindsight.

*Migrant worker NGOs have campaigned about overcrowding in dormitories for years. A 2014 medical sciences paper noted previous outbreaks of typhus and pneumonia, possibly due to dorms’ “high density” and “occasionally less than satisfactory sanitary living conditions”.*

*After the first cases in February, activists and NGOs sounded the alarm. Cai Yinzhou, the founder of Geylang Adventures, published a note with comprehensive recommendations, including decreasing the number of residents per room and earmarking dorms for suspected cases to be isolated.*",2020-04-06 14:34:57
"Hindsight???? Are you insane? Look at how many foreign worker NGOs have been saying the exact same things. TWC2, HOME, Migrant X Me etc. They have all consistently advocated for better living conditions for migrant workers for many many years. MOM has been dragging their feet all the while because they keep favouring company bosses.

This is not hindsight. We all knew that bosses in construction companies were cutting corners by giving these workers shitty living conditions. They knew they could do it because MOM doesnt enforce and couldnt give a flying f. Once a year maybe they will make an example by fining one company a measly sum but then its all back to business.",2020-04-06 14:46:20

Many doctors have been pushing for full school closure and work closure for weeks now.

"Yeah I’m surprised too that people think migrant worker dorms look like SAF bunks. Anyone who has seen how an average (read: not the worst) foreign worker dorm room looks like will surely not suggest such a comparison. IMHO, when compared to foreign worker dorms, SAF bunks will easily qualify as being five star standard. Not just the aspects of cleanliness or amenities (even just the basic need of having a working toilet), though those are very important factors, but I’ll put them aside since many would assume these aspects are due to the workers not taking care or keeping clean. 

I believe the key issue behind how fast the virus can spread in worker dorms, potentially making it a “petri dish” situation, aside from the lack of cleanliness and/or hygiene in a majority of the dorms, are the issues of poor ventilation and the severe lack of physical distancing. Most worker dorm rooms would pack say, three bunk beds within the size of a bedroom in an average HDB flat (the BTO ones, not the older flats), leaving only enough room for everyone to get up and down the beds. FWIK (from being a volunteer with ItsRainingRaincoats), most of the rooms also do not have any drawers/cupboards/wardrobes/storage. Most of the workers store their belongings in their one luggage bag which they store underneath the bottom bunks of their beds.

And by the way, about the issue of cleanliness, most migrant workers do clean up after themselves, but as with all communal living, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for everyone else. Just to quote an example, I’ve once had a housemate (I’m a room renter) who was super gross, leaving food waste and used sanitary pads lying around in the open everywhere in the house, even all over the floor of her room. 🤮 *shuddering just from recalling 😖. So no, it’s not about one’s level of education. 

P.S. The general public will likely be surprised to know that a lot of migrant workers who are working here in Singapore actually have at least a diploma from their home countries.",2020-04-06 18:20:17

"I think you’re looking at it from just one perspective of healthcare but you need to remember that the government has the uphill task of balancing all sectors of the country. It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable. It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted. 

Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places. But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for. I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing. For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are. This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism. So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have. Granted, I do not know much too but I can understand and see why the policies and implemented the way they are. 

And to blame the government on such issues they are receiving heat for, it’s not all fair to them. At the end of the day, the government makes the policies but it is the people who enact them. We wouldn’t have needed to reach the stage of a CB if the common folk took social distancing more seriously. Look at the queues at ikea, supermarkets, etc even after the CB is announced.

> SINGAPORE: A new COVID-19 cluster was reported on Saturday (Aug 22) at Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, about a month after it was declared to be ""fully cleared"" of the coronavirus.

> 

> Two of the newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Singapore are linked to 55 previous cases to form a new cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge dormitory at 500 Old Choa Chu Kang Road, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The cluster at Sungei Tengah Lodge was among the largest in Singapore before the dormitory was declared cleared of COVID-19 by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Jul 21.

> More than 2,200 confirmed cases had been linked to the cluster. MOH closed the cluster on Jul 18.

> Sungei Tengah Lodge is Singapore's biggest purpose-built dormitory, with about 16,000 workers living there.

> It was first declared an isolation area on Apr 9, and was among the first dormitories be gazetted as an isolation area under the Infectious Diseases Act. The notification was revoked on Jul 18.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> MOM and MOH said on Aug 18 that about 100 new COVID-19 cases have been detected in migrant worker dormitories that were previously given the all clear from the virus.

> Some of the new cases were picked up through routine testing that is conducted biweekly, and some of the workers had gone back to work.

> 

> EMPLOYERS MUST SCHEDULE SWAB TEST

> 

> On Saturday, authorities said employers must ensure their workers have completed a COVID-19 swab test in the past 14 days by Sep 5, as part of plans to ensure the safe restart of work. Those who have not done so will not be able to return to work.

> Workers who are staying in dormitories and those in the construction, marine and process sectors, as well as those going into the work sites, are required to undergo rostered routine testing every 14 days.

> To date, about 16,000 employers have scheduled their workers for rostered routine testing using the Health Promotion Board's swab registration system, the authorities said. About 102,000 workers who need to undergo routine testing have yet to be scheduled for a swab test.

> 

> “Employers are reminded to quickly schedule appointment slots for their workers if they have not done so, to avoid disruption to business operations,” the authorities said on Saturday.

> 

> There are currently about 13,700 workers who are still serving out their quarantine period, said MOH on Saturday, adding that they will be tested when their quarantine ends.

> ""We expect the case counts to remain high in the coming days, before tapering down thereafter,"" the health ministry said.

> Singapore reported 50 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, including two in the community and five imported infections.

> This brings the total number of cases in the country to 56,266, with fatalities remaining at 27.

> 

> Both of the community cases are Singaporeans and are currently unlinked to previous cases, the health ministry said.

> 

> One of the cases, a 63-year-old woman, was tested after being admitted to a hospital for another medical condition. The other community case, a 56-year-old woman, had gone to work at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) College Central. She was detected to have the coronavirus after she was diagnosed with acute respiratory infection.

> The five imported cases include a Singaporean man who returned from Iran on Aug 10, two dependant's pass holders, a student's pass holder and a work permit holder currently employed in Singapore.

> 

> The five imported cases were placed on stay-home notices upon arrival in Singapore, and were tested while serving their stay-home notices at dedicated facilities.

No. What you wrote is not how it's done. In a larger country, we go by towns, cities, or districts. With Singapore, we can go by GRC boundaries or drawing boundaries base on the nearest supermarket. The idea is simple. Stop all public transports that go further than however far it is needed for people to get to the nearest supermarket and have everyone do grocery shopping there and there only. This limits everyone's movement range and ensure outbreaks occur in a geographically limited manner. Not this going across the island just to buy food.

Then we establish a red, yellow, green areas. Green = no community cases for 1-2 weeks + not bordering red zones. Yellow = no community cases in 1-2 weeks but bordering a red zone. Red = active community cases. in green zones, things can be pre-covid, except masks. In red zones = maximum restrictions. Yellow = some restrictions. 

Then how people get to work. Well most should work from home. For the essential workers that relied on public transports: use the freed up buses to perform pickups, business-by-business; or restrict MRTs to ""work only"". Within businesses, do like some Singapore hospitals do and split staff into small non-interacting teams.

No we don't. Oral-fecal (or inhaled fecal aerosol) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has not been established. Viral RNA is found in feces and sewage, but viability and transmissibility has not been demonstrated. Still a good idea to flush with the lid down though.   
Spread of SARS in Hong Kong due to flushing of toilets wasn't because of flushing with the lids up. It was because of a lousy plumbing system (since banned) where floor U-traps dried out and flushing of the toilet in one apartment caused aerosol to spew out of the floor drain of the apartment above.

Creating safe bubble from small unit, may be a town or hdb estate, since most are designed to be self sufficient. Within each bubble, people can live their new normal life.

Bubbles with no cases that are next to each other can be joint up to form larger bubble slowly. Safe bubbles can start to be productive and resume work. Then they can provide support to fulfill needs from bubbles under lockdown. 

However, this is definitely not as easy as it seem. A lot of issues to think about. What if certain essential service not available in the some bubble? How do you enforce it? You literally need to create physical boundary to enforce it. Unless it’s spreading out of control, else most would think this is over reaction.

This still means that you should consider the reality that people sharing the same toilets will likely to infect each others, even if fecal matter aerosol transmission is still not demonstrated.

When I read Josephine Teo's remarks on the situation, I was extremely disheartened. It strikes me as unapologetic, quick to pin the blame on others, instead of taking accountability for policy (and human dignity) failings as minister of manpower. This time bomb has now exploded but we've known about the deplorable conditions and attitudes towards foreign workers for a long time - it was a error of commission, not ommission, in allowing the problem to fester. After this is resolved, we should not let a good crisis go to waste - let's amplify the voices pushing for positive change, let's uplevel our values, and let's hold our leaders to account.

"> # Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitories

> SINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.

> Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.

> To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.

> Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.

> Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.

> They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.

> ""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.

> 

> Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.

> In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> ""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""

> On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.

> The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.

> MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.

> Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.

> ""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""

> Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.

> ""This cannot continue,"" he said.

> Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.

> ""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) . Unless you are suggesting that an earlier lockdown WILL still result in spread because erm... magic? Because Taiwan definitely manage to prevent community spread by acting earlier.

2ndly, many in this group are in the essential services, even if you lock down a portion of them, there are many others who are required to move around on a regular basis during the lockdown potentially bringing the virus in. Given the nature of many of their job which is directly related to cleaning/ sanitizing and getting close to potential contaminated areas, it's not whether they will get it, it's when they will get it even in a lock down situation.

3rd the spread seem to have started earlier than anticipated. The link is now being correlated to the Mustafa cases which happened almost 2 weeks ago and if we factor in up to 21 days of incubation, we would have needed to lockdown as early as the first week of March or last week of Feb.

Most China workers are living here in HDB-dorms (those not construction industry at least), which can be bad but is nowhere close to the conditions like in S11 which mostly cater to construction.

"Ok first of I'd like to say that I'm not intentionally being edgy. And I'm fine with using my real name because I haven't said anything that I'm ashamed of, and if anyone tries to doxx me, they automatically lose all moral high ground. Let me rephrase what I'm trying to say here: the workers should be given the best possible conditions that we can afford. Key phrase: that we can afford. And when I say ""take office first"", I don't literally mean that you have to assume an official position in order to try and enact change, I'm asking you to look at it from a different perspective. It's very easy to criticise but if you were actually there on the ground trying to recruit volunteers, distribute medical supplies, and relocate healthcare workers, I think you would better appreciate what is already being done. I'm not saying it's perfect, not by a long shot, but I'm saying that I trust the government is doing all that it can within a reasonable capacity. I do agree that there are and will continue to be flaws, lapses and slip-ups, but I also trust that such issues will be addressed in the fastest and best possible way. I mean already in that article it outlined how efforts were being made to improve living conditions: ""cleanliness and hygiene being stepped up""', ""sickbays being scaled up"", ""thousands of workers moving to army camps, floating hotels and empty HDBs"" to ease up on the cramped conditions... I mean it doesn't really sound a lot like Omelas to me, sounds like they're actually trying hard to make it better.

Second point about hierarchy. I maintain that the Singpore government's first priority rightfully is, and always should be, Singaporean nationals. Does this mean that we should simply neglect everyone else and leave them to die in crowded conditions? Of course not! But consider if we quarantined all 20,000 workers identically to how we have been quarantining our own citizens. Our systems would be completely overwhelmed in no time. It would leave no margin whatsoever for future infections, many of whom would be nationals. If we had the space and the resources then of course they should give workers the same conditions, but sadly this isn't the case. I just want to put across the point that when we have such limited resources, no matter what couse of action you take there is always going to be someone who loses out.

Okay, as for the bit where you said this isn't just for the government, it's for everyone, I agree with you almost completely. However, it is incredibly difficult to see any kind of change coming about in the immediate future. And frankly, you should be the change that you want to see. If you're really passionate about this, then you should volunteer to cook/clean for the workers. You might say, ""oh I'm busy, I still have to work from home, etc etc"", all of which is perfectly understandable. Then maybe you should consider that this is the same situatiom which other Singaporeans are in. Now again, I'm not saying, ""you must be a volunteer, then only you can talk about how people should be more sympathetic"", I'm just saying that if everyone expressed concern online but never enacted any real change, people would be a lot more caring for our workers but the actual workers' situations would not improve.",2020-04-10 10:39:08

"> # 7,000 migrant workers quarantined after some 100 new COVID-19 cases detected in cleared dorms

> SINGAPORE — About 100 COVID-19 cases have been detected in foreign worker dormitories that were given the all-clear, resulting in some 7,000 workers being quarantined, said the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Tuesday (18 August).

> These cases – some of whom have resumed work – were detected through routine testing conducted bi-weekly for workers living in dorms as well as those who work in construction/production sites and the construction, marine, and process sectors, said the ministries in the joint statement.

> Over 100,000 workers have started on their biweekly routine tests to date, while seven in 10 employers have logged on and used an online swab registration system set up to schedule such tests.

> “We have taken timely actions to contain and isolate the COVID-19 positive cases. We have also taken aggressive actions to contain, trace, and isolate the close contacts. To date, over 60 per cent of cases have been closed,” the statement added.

> Out of some 7,000 workers quarantined from the new infection cases, less than two per cent were reported to be infected with COVID-19, said both ministries.

> The quarantined cases are “being managed according to strict protocols and reinforced with more centralised quarantine facilities made available through the completion of dormitory clearance”, they added.

> The new infected cases in cleared dorms and decant sites are a reminder of the need for vigilance, said the ministries.

> “As we gather more real-life data, we will be better able to assess the impact of safe distancing measures (SDM) and segregation measures. This will help us assess patterns in the spread of infections, and review the extent of quarantine required to contain a detected case,” they added. 

> Authorities here have completed the testing of all workers in the dorms, with around 18,600 of them currently serving out their quarantine period, including 800 who were announced by the MOH last Wednesday to be newly quarantined after the discovery of a COVID-19 case among them in a cleared purpose-built dorm block.

> Both ministries said that authorities are taking “a measured approach” to tackle such situations. It includes conveying immediate close contacts of the infected worker to serve a 14-day quarantine at a dedicated quarantine facility and testing the remaining residents.

> “We have quarantined the whole block in the first instance while the assessment is being made as a precautionary measure. We will rescind the quarantine subsequently for workers who are assessed to be not at risk,” the ministries said.

> “While this approach could affect up to a few hundred migrant workers for each case, it ensures that we contain the detected case and minimise spreading that could end up affecting thousands others,” they added.

> Other measures taken to prevent a second wave of infections in the cleared dorms include segregating workers staying in the dorms by the type of industry that they work in. Sector agencies will also work closely with the employers to assess the risk at the workplaces and put in place safety timeouts if necessary, with aggressive testing operations conducted.

> The MOH confirmed another 100 COVID-19 cases in Singapore on Tuesday, taking the country’s total to 55,938. Of the tally, some 95 per cent are foreign workers living in dorms.

"> # Over half of 94 new COVID-19 cases from Sungei Tengah Lodge; 4,500 workers quarantined

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed 94 more COVID-19 cases as of Friday (28 August) afternoon, bringing Singapore’s total to 56,666.

> Of them, four – all Singapore residents – are classified as cases in the community, while 10 are imported cases who have been placed on the stay-home notice or isolated upon their arrival here.

> Amongst the remaining 80 cases residing in dorms, 58 – over half of Friday’s daily tally – are from Sungei Tengah Lodge, who had all been placed on quarantine earlier, said the MOH.

> The vast majority of them were tested during quarantine to determine their status, or picked up through the rostered routine testing.

> “Following the detection of cases at Sungei Tengah Lodge, we had placed about 4,500 workers on quarantine, and tested about 3,000 of them so far,” added the ministry.

> The number of cases from the dorms is expected to continue to be high in the coming days as authorities complete testing of the remaining quarantined workers, it said.

> More details will be shared in the ministry’s press release later at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 168 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Thursday, 55,139 cases – some 97.4 per cent of the tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while none is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 1,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 27 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

"> # Measures to tackle COVID-19 cases in dorms early on were 'insufficient': Teo Chee Hean

> SINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

> During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.

> In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.

> “On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.

> “However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”

> While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.

> On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.

> “But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.

> The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.

> Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.

> “The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.

> Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.

> In his speech on “Resilience in a changing external environment”, Teo also spoke at length about Singapore’s efforts in providing community care facilities for patients who have mild or no symptoms.

> “We had already anticipated the need for community care facilities and had started to build them. We accelerated these plans and scaled them up, adding new capacity daily over the first few weeks of April,” he said.

> At the peak on 12 May, some 20,000 patients were being cared for at community care and similar facilities, with as many as 1,000 are admitted daily, Teo said.

> “This is more than the total number of beds in all our public acute hospitals. We mobilised resources from across our public service, government-linked companies, and the private sector to set up and run all these facilities. Healthcare volunteers stepped forward to help man them,” he stressed.

> “This is how we are able to take care of every patient without overwhelming our healthcare system and putting lives at risk.”

> The clear lesson learned during the COVID-19 outbreak is that Singapore needs to plan in peace-time “on facing the unknown, and build deep reserves of people and capabilities, so that when we face a crisis, we can act decisively, and respond flexibly and rapidly”.

> He referred to past challenges in Singapore’s history such as in 1967 when the British announced the withdrawal of their troops from the city-state. With the move, Singapore was poised to lose 20 per cent of its gross domestic product and 70,000 jobs at a time when the population was half of what it is today, Teo said.

> “We are far more resilient today than in 1967, and better positioned to create new markets, businesses, and jobs to replace the ones that will be lost.”

> Singapore also rode out the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Asian and global financial crises. “COVID-19 is an even bigger test,” he added.

> The outbreak is the first major crisis for many of the new generation of ministers and civil servants taking the lead in efforts to tackle the situation.

> The ministers have sought advice and tapped the experience and knowledge of their older Cabinet colleagues as well as consulted widely within and outside the government, Teo said.

> He added, “Over the past few months, I have worked very closely with them. We speak daily and exchange views freely. They have stepped up to the task, worked together as a team, and led from the front. This is the way that we collectively ensure resilience and continuity in our leadership team for Singapore.”

SM Tharman and Minister Dr Vivian can go on interviews with international media and look good coming out of it, while giving away very little at times in terms of information.

Another unlikeable personality, IMO, is Ho Ching. It’s made even worse by the seeming lack of restraint she has over her words on social media - the lack of class and empathy from someone of such a high standing is, frankly, quite embarrassing.

"Truth be told, Covid-19 is quite different from SARS, and while I think the government learnt a lot from SARS, we didn't pivot fast enough this time. Covid-19 is a lot more infectious than SARS, which led to the large numbers of infections seen all over the world, as well as in Singapore. 

As for what Minister Jo Teo's did / said, I think the lapses under her ministry, while not directly responsible for Covid-19, did contribute to the rapid spread of the disease amongst our migrant worker population. Had she been more amiable, less arrogant, I think more people would have given her a pass (She seems to be trying for Minister Shanmugam's style, without having his charisma). Covid-19 has really wrecked havoc all over the world. Again, all of the above are my opinions. 

With regards to Ho Ching, I wholeheartedly agree with you. It's embarrassing to see the wife of our PM act in such a childish and classless manner. So far in this crisis, I see PM Lee only when he's giving speeches, but he has been reassuring, and his messages in different languages tailored to the audience. His speeches have been lauded, on reddit, on my facebook feed from my foreign friends, as well as on the news. So, to see Mdm Ho Ching act in such an infantile manner is really disappointing. But, she's not a politician, and free to act and say as she please. I just think the way she acts and speaks isn't befitting of my respect, at least on social media. 

Again, this entire post is just my opinion. :D",2020-06-13 08:07:02

I want to get off Mr. Bones' wild ride,2020-05-01 15:36:33
"Some thoughts - given the high level numbers and the disparity between cases in the various categories (dorms only, Singaporeans/PRs, work pass holders, work permit holders etc), I barely pay too much attention anymore to the preliminary high level number that comes out at \~3pm everyday. We have to wait for the detailed updates at night to get a better sense of how the situation is progressing.

In particular, I'm paying close attention to community cases and work permit holders not living in dorms (I'm conservatively assuming these people are still part of the community, but most should be serving 14 day SHNs). I reckon we need to see both community cases only (Singaporeans/PRs + work pass holders) AND community cases + work permit holders not in dorms stay low for at least 2 weeks before we start getting our hopes up. Dorm cases pretty straight forward there - given the tight living conditions and aggressive testing, i reckon we see high numbers for a while more before we start seeing the results of the distancing measures that were implemented about 2 weeks back for the dorms.  


Also - keeping brief track of unlinked cases is also somewhat important. In particular, both the absolute number of unlinked cases on a particular day AND following up the next day or couple to see if those unlinked cases have been linked (they do tend to take a while to link some cases because contact tracing etc is a VERY tough job). This is important because if they can link a specific case to an existing cluster and/or infected person, there is a lower possibility of there being existing further community spread that the authorities don't yet know about. Ideally would like to see those unlinked numbers stay low AND have the authorities constantly being able to link cases on a daily basis (which they have).

If you need any hard evidence and/or anecdotes that social distancing works, just look at the trend of community cases and work permit holders not in dorms over the past 2 weeks. So please. PLEASE STAY AT HOME AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.",2020-05-01 23:14:37

Lots of creative breakdown that alter the actual confirmed case numbers. It should just be cases in dorm vs the rest of the community. Govt needs to keep the community figure low and not just the SG/PR number. The other issue is the clusters and unlink which adds to uncertainty. So what if the confirmed cases in community are low? We don’t know who are the asymptomatic carriers walking around which explained so many new clusters. This is worrying if the clusters are being to be bigger in numbers. Stay safe,2020-05-01 17:15:51

I think they have made the deduction that these WP holders were/are in a significantly higher risk group because of their contact with other WP holders living in dormitories and perhaps they uncovered many links to the mustafa clusters among them compared to other clusters. What I firmly believe at this point is that the non WP holders (which include SG/PR ) are most likely not exposed as much as them, unless we still have not discovered asymptomatic clusters in the community (which is possible as always)",2020-05-01 15:37:14

> 

> Singapore is entering its sixth week of a ""circuit breaker"" period to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

> After a drop in COVID-19 cases in the local community, Singapore eased some restrictions from May 5, including allowing residents to exercise in the common areas of strata-titled residential buildings such as private condominiums. Traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture was also allowed to resume for pain management.

> Some businesses, including hairdressers and home-based food businesses, will also be allowed to resume operations from May 12, with a gradual resumption of selected activities and services over a few weeks.

> As part of the gradual easing of circuit breaker measures, schools will start to bring back students in small groups for face-to-face lessons from May 19, with priority given to graduating cohorts.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong cautioned in a press conference on Friday that Singaporeans should not rush to go out when businesses reopen on May 12.

> “I know some people may not have had a haircut for some time, but there is no need to rush to go out to have a haircut on May 12. There will be time to do so,"" said Mr Wong, speaking at a COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference.

> “We are making progress because of the circuit breaker and we should continue to do our part to comply with the measures for the rest of the circuit breaker period. We should remain vigilant and not take any chances,” he said.

"\[opinion\] My Interpretation of [""backlog](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-singapore-new-cases-moh-may-3-12697698)"" cases

tldr: I am guessing that the ""backlog"" consist of the suspect cases of people who are staying in dorms which have known infections. It is different from some of you, who thinks that the ""backlog"" is due to ""less testing on weekends/ public holiday"".

I feel that new clusters with big spikes is more alarming than old clusters with big spikes (probably due to backlog).

short essay:

In early April, there was a need to increase ""**testing width**"" (to test people from different dorms to identify clusters) to quickly take action in dorms with infections. Due to finite testing capability, there was a **trade-of**f for ""**testing depth**"" (to test all suspect cases within a known cluster). This results in a large number of **suspect cases** being identified, possibly being treated as pseudo-cases in terms of medical care/quarantine, but **not immediately tested**. This develops into this ""**backlog**"".

In early May, I presumed MOH had met the ""testing width"" (tested a sizable group of people from each dorm), and now is ""widening"" the testing to include healthcare workers etc (to identify the ""community transmission""). Since the ""testing width"" is met, I presume MOH now has the ""bandwidth"" to test those previously identified suspect cases, and thus explains the spike in number for these (old) dorm clusters.

Nevertheless, I find it concerning that, on average, there are still more than 5 new clusters identified for recent days, and some of them even have a large number of new cases linked within the first few days of identification.

For example, the cluster at 5 Fourth Chin Bee Road is identified on 6 May but has 38 newly identified cases of that day linked to it, As that cluster is a new cluster, this means that these 38 cases are not ""backlog"". Hence, I consider these more alarming than old clusters having a big increase (which is probably due to ""backlog"").",2020-05-09 15:50:20
"Testing backlog being cleared is one possibility.

Another possible explanation - the CB in its current form might have already reached its full potential. To push the numbers down further, it probably has to be tightened further, but we have to consider diminishing returns. Dumping tens of billions of extra dollars and extending to July (for example, but please no) to push the average from 10 to 8 is not worth it.

More realistically though, we should think about how we can exit CB while keeping the numbers manageable and preventing them from exploding.",2020-05-09 20:41:24
I think this is due to backlog. Most likely the vast majority of the new MW cases already got infected up to a week ago but they could only confirm about 750 a day.,2020-05-09 15:33:22

"To be fair on China's part, when they (the chinese infamous for prioritizing profit over human lives) started shutting and locking down their cities, everyone else was still jerking around thinking its isolated to China or just Asia alone like how SARS was. 

The world fucked itself. It just so happened to start at China. If it started anywhere else, everyone would also be jerking off. This pandemic has made it clear, the world (and many many countries) have flawed medical systems in place and it has to change. 

It also doesn't help that the big orange just so happens to be in charge of the supposedly #1 country that people look up to for action.",2020-05-09 17:36:28
"If this could honestly be transmitted from animal to human, then it's just a matter of time before someone gotten it. Sure, it's probably China's blame to take since they're eating all the weird shit that most people have never even heard of, but it also shines a light on most governments around the world- they're super unprepared. 

If by now, China (and its neighbouring countries) has seemingly recovered, but the rest of the world hasn't, then is it really all China's fault to take?

Take for example someone bringing some spoiled food to a party, and 20minutes in Carol tells everyone that she just puked because she ate the spoiled chicken, and told everyone who has been exposed to the chicken to please take some medication now. Everyone at the party couldn't give a shit, and tells Carol to fix her shit, she probably caught something and it ain't the chicken. People continue to have the chicken, ate it then got sick, then blamed Carol for causing all the problems.

I believe credit should be where it is due, but at this point, the bigger problem is how we're not ready for pandemics at all... and instead of getting ready for it some countries are just taking the chance to sue other countries...?

Singaporeans on this sub - do you not see this comment for what it is? This person is not differentiating between Singaporean Chinese and China Chinese.

We’re sliding into a world where racism based on your ethnicity is permissible. And this is not okay. The reactions of Western govts are actually enabling these attitudes amongst their citizens. 

Sinophobia can easily backfire on most of Asia, because racist Westerners aren’t going to differentiate us. Vietnamese, Koreans are already targets of hate crimes overseas, what more Singaporeans who actually speak Chinese? I’m already expecting a more hostile world when I travel after the pandemic.

but if got bad news its somehow its the collective responsibility of all singaporeans. like millions of ppl petitioned manpower ministry to ignore their cramped overcrowded conditions for decades. or if got referendum where ppl voted that josephine teo should listen to dorm/biz owners and just leave rules up to dorm owners. who told govt to dismiss ngo's concerns for dorm conditions for years. 

some human decency should say that give these ppl a decent accommodations. at least army standard bunks with space and furnishing. 

some foresight would show that fw living in cramped conditions and deterred for years to report sick would have been prime target for virus cluster

some humbleness would have allowed you to listen to ngo's who as recent as last month wrote letter to 154 about the dorm conditions. or not treat dissenting views as enemies

"> # Coronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workers

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

Where are the RCL and Costa ships that homeport in Singapore? Not starcruise again,2020-04-17 12:54:40
"Came here to say, this will not help and it’s such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

>Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

"> # COVID-19: All foreign worker dormitories to be 'effectively' in lockdown - Josephine Teo

> SINGAPORE — All 43 purpose-built foreign workers dormitories here will soon be “effectively” on lockdown, affecting some 200,000 workers.

> During a virtual press conference led by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce on Tuesday (14 April), Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that the authorities aim to apply the same safe distancing measures implemented in isolation areas to the remaining dorms.

> Thus far, eight dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, with the latest being Cochrane Lodge II.

> “While these (other) dorms are not presented as isolation areas, we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown,” said Teo.

> Some 7,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dormitories.

> They would be placed at various activated sites such as SAF military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels, or floatels, that are typically used for offshore accommodation, as well as vacant Housing Board blocks in Tanjong Pagar and Jurong.

> About 1,300 healthy workers will be progressively relocated in batches to three floating hotels berthed at Tanjong Pagar Terminal over the next few weeks. The first batch of 31 healthy workers have been moved to a floatel.

> At least 19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified as of Monday night, including the largest cluster of 586 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> Those linked to S11 account for nearly half of the total 1,193 cases linked to clusters at foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

> On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there were another 334 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, taking the total to 3,252.

China wasn't our major point of spread. We contained the outbreak from China. The issue was that we were very slow to lockdown to EU and US - both of whom was having far 10x ore cases/capita than China by the time way locked them out.,2020-12-18 13:48:49
">Agreed with you on the masks, the govt could have just be transparent (we don't have enough for everyone

The government wasn't lying. The scientific consensus in late Feb was that there wasn't convincing proof of asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission. 

[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/no-proof-of-asymptomatic-transmission-of-coronavirus-ncid)

It didn't help that a case study written up in Germany published in a very high profile scientific journal was retracted after it turned out that the woman had symptoms after all. And the other case studies of asymptomatic transmission were rather dodgy reports from China. 

If Covid was only transmitted by sick, coughing people (like the way it was with SARS), then only sick people and health workers would need to wear masks. Wearing a cloth mask to protect yourself didn't make a lot of sense because the holes are huge. Only when it was confirmed that Covid was quite infectious before symptoms emerged did it make sense for people to wear cloth masks to protect others from their flying droplets. Try holding your hand out in front of your face and blowing with and without a cloth mask on -- you won't feel the ""wind"" when you're wearing a mask, so even if your droplets make it through the cloth, they aren't traveling far.",2020-12-18 14:44:50
"To add on to your point, even if the government was deliberately lying because they knew they didn’t have enough masks for everyone, the problem is basically that of the boy who cried wolf. You have public organisations like schools who take guidance from the government when it comes to this sort of thing. If they say no masks, then the schools are not going to enforce the wearing of them. You may also have teachers who end up reinforcing the same wrong messaging to the students, or who want to wear masks but are concerned it may lead to send the wrong messaging to others. 

So we have situations where teachers and students are facing each other the entire day, without face masks, because we trusted the government. It just didn’t help their (and our) credibility. 

Second, as a teacher, I will say that the best time to close schools and implement a CB would have been right at the start of the March holidays. To me, it’s not even hindsight, just plain common sense. You give everyone a grace period of a week to get ready what they need to prepare (eg: childcare arrangements for parents, teachers get time to prepare for HBL). Instead, the most moronic thing that could happen was that people continued to travel overseas (because what else would they do during the holidays?), despite knowing that we were in the midst of a pandemic, and the government said or did nothing! 

It was only after the holidays were almost over, that the govt slap a retroactive 2-week SHN notice on everyone who had left the country. But schools still remained open, so schools were taxed because you had staff who couldn’t show up for work, teachers were taxed because they had to prepare online lessons for students who didn’t show up for school, on top of conducting their normal classes. 

The situation was just messy and chaotic and it was clear the various ministries were not coordinating with one another. 

It’s easy to say that the government only did one or two things wrong, but these have ripple effects that affect a lot of other organisations and people, and us on the ground bore the brunt of the fallout. Just a lot of negative work that could have been avoid right from the get go, had the government been a lot more firm and decisive.",2020-12-18 13:26:57
"i have the exact opposite sentiment... I don't really fault them on the mask issue since they were working with the information that was known at that point of time and it was important to reserve the limited stock for our healthcare workers while not causing undue panic... and with regards to border control, it was not only about China but also Europe... we took our own sweet time to restrict travellers from Europe back when the cases there first exploded...",2020-12-18 13:47:42

As for countries that reached quickly enough, Taiwan? Thanks to nature of their relationship with China, they rightfully suspected that China was trying to cover up the pandemic as early as in December, and so started screening passengers from China, as well as stocking up on sufficient quantities of PPE and mandating the wearing of masks early on. 

You are talking about a lag time of 3-4 months. 

Meanwhile, it was painfully clear early on that the WHO was in cahoots with China in covering up the spread of the virus, and our government still continued to listen to and adhere to their guidance like suckers.

Imagine you are sick. You can either see a doctor right away, or wait until the condition gets worse, then have to spend more money at the hospital. Same outcome either way, but one solution is more cost-efficient than the other, because action was taken quickly enough. 

Remind me again - why were the beneficiaries when all the foreign workers were being housed in crammed living conditions? And who are the ones paying for housing and feeding them now? Definitely not the dorm owners who previously raked in all the profits, that’s for sure. 

The point isn’t that the money cannot be used for the benefit of our people and the economy of our country. You have to take it out, you have to take it out. I continue to stand by my initial assertion that the money wasn’t used as efficiently as it could because of missteps by the government. 

The COVID-19 situation appears to be largely under control in Singapore, but I wouldn’t be so quick as to pat the government on their back and congratulate them on a job well done.

Because that is the way the dorm operators earn. I actually worked in a shipyard and have first hand experience with the dorms and I can tell you that the only expectations they have for the dorms are that it is liveable. The workers all have to make do with the cramped living conditions, no mattresses, and barely functioning toilets. And that is because their welfare is an afterthought that is only catered to on special occassions or when there happens to be extra budget for it.

Address this argument and stop making groundless claims.",2020-12-18 20:35:08
"The workers were unemployed during the CB period because local businesses were not allowed to operate. That's what led to our local economic crisis. Not a closure of borders, but because shops were not open for people to spend money.

I mean, look at the current situation. Our borders are still closed (more or less), but many businesses are still able to operate (shopping malls are packed), people are still able to WFH and connect with foreign businesses via Zoom or Webex, and life goes on.

Here's what I believe would have happened had we closed our borders earlier like what Taiwan did. It's like when a company recalls all their products because a small batch may be faulty. It's extreme, but you know that you won't have any more cases because of it. You can then focus on managing the issue internally, without having to worry about what's happening beyond your shores.

Yes, there would be companies that would suffer like SIA and tour agencies, but the amount of money that would need to be channeled towards propping them up would be a drop in the bucket compared to the 92 billion spent in total. Or just let them close, like what happened with Robinsons.

So people can't come in and out of Singapore (at least not easily). We can still import food and other necessities. The government would be able to focus all their energies on managing the dormitory situation because their attention is not split between 2 battles on two different fronts. We may not even have needed a CB in the first place if the cases were coming mostly from the foreign workers (whom the government continued to confine in the same places anyways).

Sometimes, all it takes is one wrong decision to have a domino effect. This may have been it. The decision to take China and the WHO at their word. And we have been paying for that mistake ever since.

Credit where credit is due for the situation currently being under control. But also let's not forget how we even got here in the first place, especially when dealing with a government who is all to eager to claim all the credit for themselves when something goes well, and shirk all responsibility when things go south.",2020-12-18 20:53:24
">For the covid case. I partially don’t like how they shift the goal pool. Previously they used to report past infection and included in case country , but this time they only revealed 47% of the foreign workers were infected at the “phase 3 announcement”.

They did not shift the goal posts. The case count goes up only if the person tests positive using a PCR test. They are not added in if they test positive only for serology. This is in line with international practice.

If anything I think MOH has been transparent in all their information provided. Of course, more information would be appreciated but still. IMO, look at the press releases instead of looking at the media reports. Prepare for more BTW, they still have 65k left to serology test.

>I see the Govt response as one that learn from past mistake. Like how they did for SARS but slow to adept to new situation because no textbook answer to follow. Just like how most scholars behave.

What did they fail to adapt to fast enough? Other than TW that can afford to not care about what CN thinks and closed their borders to them almost immediately, which are the other countries that adapted faster?

The 2 things that I think they can do better are the dorms & mask wearing. Given that they did contain a small cluster initially at a construction site successfully & the scientific evidence that suggested that no masks were required then + little understanding of asymptomatic spread, I think it is reasonable how they have performed.

There are also things that they talked about or did that I feel, are ahead of others - considering fatigue settling in (this was even before CB happened), not to give up on tracing, as well relaxation of measures slowly (maybe a bit too slow) to prevent resurgence, to name a few.",2020-12-18 12:33:43

> 

> Previously, such workers had been advised by the ministry to stay at home during their rest days in the first phase of Singapore's post-""circuit breaker"" reopening.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> In its advisory to employers on Wednesday, MOM outlined ""appropriate arrangements"" for foreign domestic workers during the next phase of reopening, adding that the advisory would ""remain in force until withdrawn"".

> These arrangements include seeking the consent of employers for taking rest days on a weekday, maintaining safe distancing measures and downloading the TraceTogether app.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""FDWs who wish to spend their rest days outside should seek the consent of their employers to do so on a weekday when public spaces are less crowded,"" said MOM.

> They should also inform their employers of their whereabouts, said the ministry, adding that workers are also strongly encouraged to download and activate the TraceTogether app to facilitate contact tracing.

> While out on their rest day, foreign domestic workers are also advised to continue adhering to safe distancing measures, said MOM. These include:

> 

> Wearing a mask and maintaining a safe distance from one another

> Observing good personal hygiene and avoiding sharing food, drinks and other personal items

> Reducing their time spent outside and limiting the number of contacts that they meet

> Complying with safe distancing measures at malls and public places and not gathering in groups of more than five

> The ministry also advised workers not to ""gather or loiter in public spaces"" or visit crowded places such as City Plaza, Lucky Plaza and Peninsula Plaza.

> For those who want to remit money at these places, the Monetary Authority of Singapore has already advised remittance agents that they should schedule appointments with clients, said the ministry.

> Alternatively, foreign domestic workers are encouraged to conduct remittance via electronic platforms.

> MOM said it would be carrying out inspections on the ground, and would disperse large groups and outdoor gatherings.

> Those who do not cooperate risk being fined and having their work passes revoked.

> ""As we all adapt to the new normal, it is important to maintain open communication with your FDW and help your FDW understand the above guidelines and requirements,"" said MOM.

> ""Our community needs to stay disciplined and vigilant ... so that all our efforts so far to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are not wasted.""

> On Monday, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced Phase 2 of Singapore's reopening, after the country exited a two-month-long circuit breaker designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.

> Phase 2 will involve the resumption of “most activities”, subject to safe distancing principles.

> 

> Small gatherings of up to five people will be allowed to resume, along with dining in at food and beverage outlets. Retail businesses may also reopen their physical outlets.

> 

> By Phase 3, social, cultural, religious and business gatherings or events should be able to resume, although gathering sizes will still have to be limited in order to prevent large clusters.

"Some info to note (I can't read the full text unfortunately, might be redundant):

These migrant workers are usually subjected to medical checkups before starting work, and usually work at construction sites. Most are also under 40, and are usually in their 20s and 30s. Usually quite young and healthy. 

About 15 cases resulted in deaths, but were recorded as not due to Covid-19 infection. Causes of death were mostly ischaemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (although one was a fall from height).

Around 55,000 workers of the 323,000 in dormitories were confirmed infected through PCR testing. However, later serological tests, which 258,000 were subjected to, suggest about 98,000 more were infected than detected. This is probably due to insufficient testing in the early stages of the outbreak.

EDIT: Most of the dormitories were placed under quarantine (no one in, no one out, no intermingling between different floors, masks mandated), and the community outside the dorms was put under lockdown (masks mandated, all schools and non-essential workplaces closed, social gatherings totally banned). Despite this, by late April, infections were far outstripping testing capacity. Because of this, for a period of time those who were symptomatic were only quarantined, and so were their contacts; testing was not carried out for many who were asymptomatic, and was delayed for those who were symptomatic.

EDIT 2: The dormitories were also a ""worst case scenario"" for infections. Workers working at a single construction site usually live in different dormitories. They endured sustained physical labour, at a time when masks weren't yet mandated. And social distancing is impossible, because of how dense the dorms are.",2021-02-10 21:59:50
But that is not logical. Contact tracing and isolation will not determine if someone is sick enough to go to hospital/ICU.  The person's health status/response to the virus will. Also 110k/200k is 60% (off the top of my head). That is a huge percentage of the population to be infected and clearly isolation was not effective or this percentage would be significantly lower.,2021-02-10 21:22:40
Another thing that might be just as important is that the mean age of these migrant workers would be in the early 30s/late 20s. These are mostly relatively fit young men who work in a physically demanding field.,2021-02-10 23:29:02

And yes, a large majority of local cases were from the migrant worker population. However, we are told there are 59,000+ cases, not nearly as high as this article states. However, we have had 29 confirmed deaths, more than the article attests.

That's more than 5 times higher than the number reported in this article and is a vast underestimate of the real number in the US. 

Notably, this statistic is completely unaffected by their public health campaign seeking to reduce total infections. The only explanations I can think of are that 1) these migrant workers are very healthy and have a much, MUCH lower risk of serious disease; 2) they overestimated total and clinical cases by using a test with a very high false positive rate; 3) they did not collect the complete number of ICU admissions and deaths among their study population.

Option 1) is certainly true but I personally don't believe is great enough to explain the full discrepancy. If 2) and 3) did not happen, then I guess this is better evidence for the amazing disease resistance among migrant workers in Singapore than it is for the success of their public health campaign.",2021-02-10 22:55:36

Abstract

High-density communal residences are at elevated risk of large outbreaks of respiratory disease.1,2 After an initial nationwide outbreak of 231 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in Singapore, which was contained as of March 24, 2020, a surge of 244 cases among migrant workers residing in dormitories, largely from Bangladesh and India, occurred from March 25 to April 7. A national task force was formed to coordinate Singapore’s outbreak response. A national lockdown from April 7 to June 1 enforced movement restriction and confined workers to their dormitories. Medical posts were deployed on-site in all dormitories, and testing capacity for testing and screening residents increased. All workers with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result were admitted to health care facilities for isolation and treatment. We examined the prevalence and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection among migrant workers in Singapore.",2021-02-10 20:36:54
"This sounds incredibly implausible to me. How could they get the death rate to 0.001% when the usual death rate is between 0.3%-1%?

It is useful to remember that Singapore *is* an authoritarian state without free media. Its entirely likely the numbers are fudged or that they are only counting Singaporean citizens.

If it's the latter, that is still very impressive. It means they controlled the spread within their city.",2021-02-11 02:34:49

"Wrong, testing, tracing doesn't affect the death rate. What does affect the death rate is the health of the population being infected and the amount of virus they are exposed to. The migrant worker population in Singapore is very healthy and has no old people, they are health screened every year so the rate of pre-existing conditions is very low. The climate of Singapore ensures that viral exposure is low, corona virus doesn't like the heat, it is seasonal prefering cold climates (hence the seasonal recurrence in the northern higher latitudes this winter)",2021-02-11 10:00:41

You would think that in the age of a global pandemic that major publications like Cosmopolitan would try their hardest or at least try not to glorify obesity. Instead, they release magazine covers of obese women saying “this is healthy!”

I get being progressive and trying not to fat shame people, but do they really need to go out of their way and say “this is healthy!”? All they’re doing is telling people who are obese that they are perfectly fine the way they are- which they’re not.

">migrant workers in Singapore will tend to be young

You are right, most of them are not the vulnerable groups. And yes most of our cases are from migrant workers where the infection rate is high in dormitories. These workers were isolated from the community, nothing much relevant to contact tracing though.",2021-02-10 23:58:56
"Living in Singapore at the moment, and the government was really great at pre-emptive testing. Before they allowed schools to reopen, everyone working in schools had to go through COVID testing. As a result, they caught a LOT of asymptomatic cases.  All contacts of those COVID cases, including asymptomatic cases had to go through COVID testing & quarantine, and they caught even more asymptomatic cases that way. 

That’s why the case numbers were so high but the death rate was so low. We were warned that COVID is far more infectious but way less lethal than previously thought ages ago. 

Singapore had a 2 month lockdown but life is nearly back to normal now. My daughter goes to preschool & she’s maskless since she’s under 2, restaurants & bars are open, malls are busy. The only difference is we all wear masks.",2021-02-10 23:38:10
"If they manage to avoid infecting vulnerable groups, it's very possible. The infection death rate for people under <40 is estimated to 0,002%, or 1 out of 50.000.",2021-02-10 23:15:34
"It can help by limiting exposure to more vulnerable populations. For example, pretend a migrant worker works in a restaurant. That person gets sick. They contact trace everyone who was in the restaurant during that time, and find people who work in the local nursing home, people with elderly folks living in their home, etc, and those people end up taking extra precautions. The migrant worker might have got everyone sick in the restaurant, and likely everyone sick in their household, but those secondary infections are less likely to infect the old people this disease likes to kill.

Other confounding factors might include migrant workers having fewer older relatives in the household, which limits their infections to younger people, and stuff like that.

Edit: it’s not clear that the contract tracing is causative and not just highly correlative... but it obviously doesn’t hurt.",2021-02-10 23:18:58
"it didnt make sense to me initially either, but its because of the causal implication from the language used in the title. The contact tracing and high level of testing didnt lead to a reduce severity of covid. it led to a higher rate of identification of covid+ in mild/asymptomatic patients relative to other countries.

The title here is also inaccurate in stating that isolation contributed to this outcome.",2021-02-10 23:52:53

"The case fatality ratio seems to be around 1.5% in other countries. Why is it so low here?

Edit: Does anyone have an estimate of the number of asymptomatic cases to symptomatic cases?",2021-02-11 00:28:47
"This!  Covid19 in Singapore is basically restricted to healthy young migrants.  Certainly contact tracing helped keep those people from infecting the general population, but the low death rate is entirely due to who got sick.",2021-02-11 00:01:51

The true ratio of infections to severe cases in Singapore and the US is likely just about the same, but increased detection of cases in Singapore drives that ratio way up",2021-02-11 00:12:12
"Yeah some of the other aspects don't make direct sense either; isolation reduces infections, not deaths, which were already high.

If we were as good at testing in the US as they are in Singapore, we'd find our real mortality rate is far far lower.",2021-02-11 03:08:20

"Imagine you are told that you have been exposed before you start showing symptoms... so you call your doctor and get advice and medication early. And you adjust your behavior to avoid going to an elderly family member's house or to work. 

In short, contact tracing helps with early intervention and behavior change.",2021-02-10 23:16:36
"If you have 100 people in a room and 10 have the flu, but only 1 shows symptoms and you only test that person, you get a 1% infection rate. The other 9 are allowed to mingle with the healthy people. If you test 90 people your chances of testing all 10 sick people rise dramatically. Those 9 people who dont get as sick count as cases. So with Covid you can catch it and not even know. So you count as a case even though you are perfectly healthy, but can pass it on. So they found a bunch of asymptomatic people, told them ""stay home for a few weeks"" and the people did just that.",2021-02-10 23:46:04
Bingo. Your analysis is correct.,2021-02-11 00:46:16
"Thanks for your insights. Don’t discount the fact that migrant workers have been in prolonged detention for almost a year now. Much easier to effectively contract trace when you’ve walled off your hot spots and restricted movement of that sub pop. When you remove the migrant worker sub pop, and cases identified at borders, from the overall community spread numbers (as Singapore did) the picture overall gets quite rosy.",2021-02-11 00:52:23
"But wouldnt contact tracing only be effective if they work quickly enough before more people are added to the contact list thus almost exponentially spreading it. 

My thought process on that, and correct me if I'm wrong. But if they are not able to inform the person quickly enough, they potentially have the entire time before they are notified to spread the virus. And of course as it spreads more the contact list gets larger and larger and makes the response time even slower. I definitely think it is a great idea. But I'm not so sure it is as effective as we initially thought.

 (Of course something is better than nothing but still, something isnt the best and we should never stop striving to be the best we can be. Not only for ourselves but for those around us.)

I'm also aware that this isnt quite the topic OC is on. But I think it might be worth it to bring up, discussions often resolve in solutions. So lets keep this civil please. No matter your perspectives or believes on this subject.",2021-02-11 00:54:10
"I think it make sense if you look into the the people who are infected. The majority infected are the migrant workers who are young, healthy and mostly work in the construction and manual sector. This workers are able to withstand and survive the covid infection much better especially if the Singapore gov is doing very serious tracing and testing, hence any positive cases were isolated and are brought to immediate healthcare if necessary. Local community cases are contained and few. If the high risks and weak arent exposed to covid infection, death rate and ICU cases will definitely tends to be much lower.",2021-02-11 01:08:34

"It might artificially reduce the rate of serious cases simply because you find more cases (while other countries may find less cases, so their rates are inflated because they underestimate the denominator).",2021-02-11 01:30:52
"True. The correlation between the number of cases and number of deaths doesn't make sense. Regular testing wouldn't drop the fatalities just hopefully stop the spread. Which 100,000 cases is a small number so maybe it worked. I would say population stats has a big effect. But with only 1 death there could be a lot of hiding stats. If a senior caught it they would be reported with underlying conditions for example",2021-02-11 01:32:20
"Confirmed cases is an estimate of the true cases. Increasing testing will get confirmed cases to match to the true case numbers. 

If Singapore was indeed testing far more than other countries, then the difference between true cases versus confirmed cases will be a fraction of what other countries are seeing.

This in turn will make the hospitalization rates far smaller than other nations'.

Seroprevalence data has shown that many countries are getting anywhere from only 1 in 2 cases or as low as 1 in 20 cases out there.

"There may also be *some* genetic factors at play. Look at Thailand.  I don’t know enough about the migrant labor situation to say though.   

We also know that efficient masking can reduce viral load exposure which we are pretty sure *does* reduce severity. It could be as simple as good cultural norms around wearing a mask everywhere, having it be a high quality mask, and *wearing it correctly*. 

Efficient testing & contact tracing means they catch every case including all the asymptomatic mild ones.  So that does impact the “severity” averages of the dataset in question.  

Finally, if you’re giving everyone top level antivirals and antibody treatments the same day they first test positive, that really could impact the severity rate on a mass scale.

Their living conditions in mass dormitories was poor and Covid spread very fast through their dormitories and wasn't noticed until it was too late, however mass testing and isolation was used after to keep further spread from happening. It's also worth noting that while we only had one recorded Covid Death amongst them, a number more infected individuals (can't recall the exact figure but it was sub 20) passed away which weren't classified as Covid related. I recall reading that a couple were due to falls and work related injuries but some were from heart conditions and things which might have been bad reactions.
I'd say the low death rate was due to them being healthy and physically fit, and also due to the quick response in isolating infected individuals via testing and prioritising healthcare for them.",2021-02-11 21:48:35

">2) they overestimated total and clinical cases by using a test with a very high false positive rate

This is a possibility, but the high number of infections was determined by serological testing after the fact to track the full number of infections within the worker dormitories. Note that the worker dorms were probably the worst-case scenario - very dense, and unable to socially distance themselves from possible infection.

>3) they did not collect the complete number of ICU admissions and deaths among their study population.

This is more unlikely, given the sheer amount of public scrutiny together with how detailed the daily (!) reports that the Ministry of Health in Singapore puts out.

One thing that probably contributed to the low death rate was probably the proactive medical care going out to the workers - because there was a HUGE public backlash against the government about infections in the worker dormitories. So the health and manpower ministries instituted a pretty hard watch on any possible infectious spread - the moment a migrant worker was detected to have covid-19 (whether or not they had symptoms), they were off to a quarantine facility and under 24-hour medical observation and all their close contacts were isolated, monitored, and screened again for potential infection (and if they were infected, the chain continues). There was no cost to the workers at all, and any attempt by the dorm owners or employers to prevent workers from reporting symptoms were dealt with pretty harshly after one case created even more public backlash. So this resulted in all the infected migrant workers having really fast access to quality medical care at no financial burden to themselves, even in the early onset of symptoms. So coupled with them being in the safest health group, likely contributed to the abnormally low death rate.",2021-02-11 18:22:12
">3) they did not collect the complete number of ICU admissions and deaths among their study population.

Partially true? I can't read the paper so I don't know when the study was conducted, but there were 15 or so deaths jn dormitories (although I believe only one or two were considered due to Covid). I'd lean towards 1), they're probably healthier than the general population.",2021-02-10 23:01:55

Strict preventative measures (mandatory quarantines, social distancing, mask wearing, etc.) also help slow down the spread, as testing alone doesn’t let you stay ahead of the virus transmission. 

Because the spread of the virus is slowed, hospitals are not overburdened and effective care is able to take place. It also helps that healthcare in Singapore is one of the best in the world, but that wouldn’t make a difference if the hospitals didn’t have the capacity to look after infected patients.",2021-02-11 21:45:13

Bigger countries have a larger number of hospital staff, doctors, public health officials, and people to do contact tracing.

the response of the public health system is the single greatest predictor of a country’s Covid success, or failure.

"The truth is that the pandemic was taken seriously when the govt realised that it was going to spread if serious actions were not taken. Almost all citizens except for essential workers were told to stay at home. School were closed and so were childcares.

Foreign workers were stopped from leaving their dormatories but given free wifi and calling cards to entertain themselves.

The foreign workers were strong and fit and most of them had minor symptoms. One of the most serious foreign worker cases was one of the earlier ones where a man who had kidney issues caught the cirus. He was basically in the ICU for 3 to 4 months and survived.

We tested on migrant workers who are being isolated from the community when we are already isolating them. Questionable decision?

Plus, there's top-notch healthcare that never got overcrowded like in other countries we've seen in the news. Compared to when I was doing law in the UK the past few months, the way many countries have been handling it is very sad to see. People have been fined and had their work passes revoked for breaking distancing rules and not wearing masks in public, leading to a very low transmission rate. Though at first we were shocked to realise there was a large amount of cases, it was soon found out that it was because of aggressive testing of all possible contacts of sick people to the third degree and beyond, which added many asymptomatic people to the number of infected persons, while quarantining them and ensuring they did not spread to vulnerable groups of people. This indirectly leads to the large amounts of infections but low death rates. 


Singapore's been prepared for another epidemic since the SARS episode of 2002-04, schools closed down and reverted to online learning really quickly, since we had a small amount of cases, we can see how many people actually got it and which clusters they caught it from in the news, which was updated daily. They actually named the cases by number and let the public know which areas the infected people visited. That's how ridiculously small Singapore is. Imagine being able to read in the news where each and every infected person visited. My family members and friends actually avoided the places that infected people visited for a few days. Its really no wonder Singapore has some of the best statistics when it's come to handling Covid.",2021-02-11 07:30:08
"Singapore is pretty equatorial, and more vitamin D translates to less problematic infections. That's likely a factor.",2021-02-11 07:22:51
"It's the mass testing. It's not only possible but likely that the US has twice the number of cases it's reported. Simply because no one's tested. Remember early on when it was ""if you have symptoms, just stay home and assume you have it"". Well if you did, you never got counted. 

This isn't to say the US's response hasn't been as terrible as everyone thinks, it has been. But mass testing does make these stats (1/100,000) WAY easier to acheive",2021-02-11 06:43:09

"I work in a VERY busy urgent care clinic in Brooklyn about 70 hours a week as a PA. I’ve diagnosed almost 1000 patients with COVID. THIS season I have only sent to 2 patients to the ER. The rest had very mild to mod flu symptoms. It was way worse last March. But now it’s VERY MILD.

I know this is the internet and it’s hard to believe an anonymous person on Reddit. But I had to offer my own experience.",2021-02-11 20:53:10
Sure it does.  It's extremely obvious to the casual observer that covid is less deadly to those of east / SE asian heritage.  There is certainly a generic factor involved,2021-02-11 06:31:22

"Realize that using data can be useful but since this virus is different for each person you can only use generic trends from across the world so much.  If a person had a pandemic outbreak through their ancestral history, they could be less susceptible to severe cases. I’m not a doctor but that’s my understanding from what I read from statisticians. You’d be able to find little more trends if, let’s say, you focused on individuals within a certain sub-group for example the 100% genetically Italian group. Then you can draw a synopsis from that possibly? 

This is something never seen before having 20181717 different symptoms comes from the same virus.",2021-02-11 05:12:54

Singapore deserves acclaim for enforcing strict rules early and abiding by them. They don't deserve much credit for how they handled their migrant workers which this article seems to want to do. Contact tracing helped isolate but even better for that is the migrant population is already isolated by social and economic barriers. To prevent the spread they further locked down all the migrant workers for months while the virus spread through that portion of the population.,2021-02-11 05:32:30
"Everything has severe penalties in Singapore though. The way they operate would not work in most of the rest of the world. We could've done much better in the US and Western Europe, but people are stupid (especially here in the US)",2021-02-11 00:30:36

"Age could easily explain this. COVID-19 mortality increases by around 4 orders of magnitude from young to old. If the vast majority of infected people in this study were young adults, as I imagine the case to be, then a 500-fold drop in mortality compared to Western countries doesn't seem out of the ordinary.",2021-02-11 03:07:17
95% of all infections are in the migrant workers who are mostly in their 20s and 30s working in labour intensive jobs.  They were more likely to import it and they live in crowded accomodation.  Anyone over 45 who gets Covid is admitted to hospital automatically - universal healthcare is important in a pandemic.   They didn't let it run through aged care.  In a lot of Western countries Covid was allowed into Aged Care facilities where it killed half the residents.,2021-02-11 04:19:10
"I suspect it is the way Singapore treats those who have been infected. Initially, all infected patients have to remain in the hospital. When numbers went up, facilities were set up and the asymptotic and less serious cases stayed in those facilities. The patients are monitored. The infected were not allowed to be discharged until they test negative two times in a roll. I think that extra attention, however small, could have helped kept symptoms in check.

I can imagine that those who have the disease and are sent home, in other countries, have to to monitor and manage their status entirely on their own. They would have to judge whether they were becoming more ill. At least here in Singapore the mild cases can get attention almost immediately in those facilities.",2021-02-11 03:53:14
Well Singapore has good healthcare. One of the best in Asia.,2021-02-11 03:27:01
Look at the flu deaths this year and compare all cause mortalities in the US in 2020 compared to past years,2021-02-11 04:43:02
"I moved out of Singapore to the US just a month before the lockdowns started. I was still receiving the daily alerts for Covid cases in my other iPhone with the SG number. 

There were instances were I would see that there is 0 death for the day on the daily recap, and yet there is a news article of a non-Singaporean/non-permanent resident who died from Covid complications on that same day, not even on the same week.

That made me infer that the fatality count was probably just taking into account deaths of Singapore locals and permanent residents. 

The 200k infected construction workers and foreign professionals on work visas are all not in that criteria. As of last year, about 1.2M of the 6M+ Singapore population are non-local and non-PR, so you have an idea of the population makeup.

Anyway of course this is anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt and please don’t quote me on this.

Edit: I did chat about this with friends so somewhere in my photo album and Whatsapp in my other phone, there is a screenshot of the daily Covid stats and the news article link to one of the deaths that was not recorded as a Singapore Covid death. I just can’t be bothered to get the receipts right now.",2021-02-11 14:31:39
"Maybe 0.004% is the correct rate and 0.1% is inflated through bad data. 

The UK count anyone who died of any cause within 28 days of a positive covid test as a covid death. 

It's not suprising that this would lead to a higher total and rate than a more precise measure.",2021-02-11 04:40:10
"It does though. 

Mass testing -> Covid doesn't spread as much -> less deaths per capita

"It does though, if they truly are catching all the asymptomatic cases then the denominator for the death rate goes up. Also demographics of the cases drastically affects the death rate, and migrant workers tend to be young. So it seems that the contact tracing was able to prevent the spread in older people.",2021-02-11 04:46:09
"Basically other countries have had wayyy more cases than they think. Since virus is far less lethal, but far more infectious than thought, the true number of infections per severe cases is far higher than case numbers in the US for example would suggest.

Edit: I think this fact combined with the young population of the study explains what’s going on here. I think as someone pointed out, just the fact I stated before the edit would only partially explain what’s going on.",2021-02-11 05:56:27

ETA: this does not in my eyes change the significance of COVID. It truly becomes very deadly as you go up age ranges. You can see that the next age range, 40-65 has significantly more deaths. These aren't just grandfathers and grandmothers but many working dads and mothers as well

Edit 2: yes this is still 30 times worse than 1 in 50,000. This is just the only source I know of to contribute actual sourced numbers. And as others have pointed out, US data may not be indicative of global death rates in that age range due to our...unique...health care and obesity situation.",2021-02-10 23:54:22

At the time, the total case count for <40 group (in the US, I'm assuming, since CDC data) was 5,340,183. Total deaths in that group was 3,808. Ends up being about 1 in 1400 fatality rate. But that's without any kind of adjusting for people having it and not being counted because they didn't get tested or otherwise felt fine.

Edit: found it! https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#demographics

More recent data suggests even lower death rate than the data from December. Again, the reality is probably even lower because so many people in the younger demographics are probably not getting tested or even getting significant enough symptoms to care.",2021-02-11 00:01:42

If, due to a really effective track & trace system, exposure is limited (eg, you meet one person carrying some degree of the virus, versus meeting 20 over the course of a couple of days, before it is picked up) it is entirely possible to have higher infection rates but lower severe cases.

I'm not 100% sure about Singapore, but it does appear to be a possibility.

It also seems to depend on strain, and those with lower viral load have a lower chance of developing antibodies.)",2021-02-10 23:49:14

With all due respect, I tire of your overly simple hand-waving. There's a distinctly American assumption - these countries may be technologically advanced, but they're ideologically backwards. Their successes are due to strong governments fudging figures, rather than intelligent and thoughtful public health responses. They have no public accountability - no thinking population - and therefore no one will ask questions if people and numbers appear how the government wants.

Of the ~55k, 15 (*not* 15k) or so of the covid patients were reported to have died due to illnesses such as heart attack, and only 1 case was directly as a result of covid.

But I'm not in singapore, and most people on this site aren't either.

and whatever that comma is used for, the title is still broken because 200,00 doesn't mean anything.

comma is either used for decimal separation or for separating thousands. 00 is not thousands.

from a standard point of view, a comma is the preferred way to show decimals, and nothing is supposed to be used to separate thousands.

quoting the same wiki page again:

>The 22nd General Conference on Weights and Measures declared in 2003 that ""the symbol for the decimal marker shall be either the point on the line or the comma on the line"". It further reaffirmed that ""numbers may be divided in groups of three in order to facilitate reading; neither dots nor commas are ever inserted in the spaces between groups""[24] (e.g. 1000000000). This usage has therefore been recommended by technical organizations, such as the United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology.[25]

>Past versions of ISO 8601, but not the 2019 revision, also stipulated normative notation based on SI conventions, adding that the comma is preferred over the full stop.[26]

>ISO 80000-1 stipulates that ""The decimal sign is either a comma or a point on the line."" The standard does not stipulate any preference, observing that usage will depend on customary usage in the language concerned, but adds a note that as per ISO/IEC Directives all ISO standards should use the decimal comma.

"So, In the study we’re counting migrant workers, so they will be mostly young and healthy. They’ve had 110k cases, and 1 death. Finland has had 50k cases and 10 deaths of people under the age of 50 (mostly young and healthy).  That means Singapore’s migrant workers have a ~100x lower death rate than finish people under 50. 

Singapore is counting their cases for migrants workers and other members of the population separately. Overall Singapore’s non-migrant population has had 60k cases, and 53 deaths. As compared to Finland’s overall cases of 50k and 700 deaths. Singapore’s ageing non-migrant population somehow has (significantly) less than a 10th of the death rate of Finland. 

I think 1 or more orders of magnitude difference in survivability suggests that Singapore’s numbers are being distorted somehow (I don’t mean to imply intentionality, I am no conspiracy theorist). 


Even if Finland’s actual cases are 100k, and Singapore is catching all of them, the most favourable situation, they still have a fatality rate 1/5th of Finland’s. Or 150k cases for Finland: Singapore has 1/3rd the fatality rate.",2021-02-11 08:42:34

"The JAMA article is solely about the migrant worker Covid situation, which accounts for ~95% of Singapore’s cases. The migrant workers were essentially locked up for months in a largely successful attempt to keep the virus in their dorms and out of the wider community. This is obviously controversial, but it spared the locals.

The other 28 deaths were not migrant workers, and mostly elderly citizens and visitors.

There are around 60,000 official cases based on PCR testing, but serological testing of the migrant workers revealed that many had been infected and recovered prior to mass testing, hence the estimate of 100,000 true cases.

There was some under-counting of deaths as a handful of migrant workers died of cardiovascular events around when they were positive, plus a couple of probable suicides (cause of death = fall from great height). The authorities say that counting these deaths separately is in line with WHO definitions.",2021-02-11 14:43:53

"There have been 29 deaths in the country but only 1 amongst the foreign labourers. So what you need to realize is with the outbreak of the virus these workers were very quickly locked up in the dormitories and separated from the rest of the nation, which definitely had its own human right issues but let's not open that can of worms. These workers were isolated, strictly monitored and maybe even tested so they would receive prompt medical attention if they got the virus. This isn't a case study of the country as a whole but how it worked out in the isolated foreign worker communities. 

So this 1/100,000 death rate thing may not be that miraculous when you consider that they were under lock and key. But then again I've never compared it to any other facilities such as prisons.",2021-02-12 12:21:36
"Also the risk of death for the age group under 25 is at a tiny fraction of a tiny fraction of a percent of the case rate. It really hasn't been shown enough but the risk with age goes up by orders of magnitude with every decade older, migrant workers tend to be very young.

I can praise singapore's spread management, but I refuse to believe their people are magically immune to a virus that is wrecking havoc everywhere else. A 1/110000 death rate is a death rate youd expect from a fully vaccinated population. Singapore isn't that so its simply more likely their government is simply lying about the numbers.",2021-02-11 05:54:10

It simply dosent make sense and I will bet its the numbers OP posted that are wrong. Based on other replies it also seems to be the case. On top of that Singapore probably also register the dearth differently. Like how some of the deaths are registered as heart failure even though they had covid 19. That can be discussed if that's correct or not but other countries are registering them as covid 19 dearth.

Going from the numbers in this thread it seems the dearth rate is closer to 0.07% which is a lot more reasonable than 0.001%
Still a bit low but maybe the other factors can explain the rest.",2021-02-11 20:47:51

And it's not like Singapore is the country that test the most. Denmark has 2.5 million test per 1 million population so clearly a lot have been tested mulitple times. And Denmark is far from the 1 in 100k numbers even if you only look at the 18 to 40 age group.",2021-02-11 20:30:34

"Australia has also had fewer cases and a higher death rate, but our social habits differ. In Singapore the elderly live with family and are cared for by family and live in domestic helpers. In Australia, our elderly are cared for in nursing homes. Once the virus got into our nursing homes it was devastating and the death rate soared. The typical living conditions of Singapore's elderly population protected them from widespread exposure from the virus. If you analyse the age of people with corona in Australia and Singapore you will see that fewer elderly were impacted in Singapore contributing to the lower death rate. I examined the data of US, Australia, NZ and Singapore in mid 2020.

Several orders of magnitude? Are you sure?

Singapore had 59732 cases and 29 deaths, a death rate of 0.048%

New Zealand had 2324 cases and 25 deaths, a death rate of 1.07%

1.07 / 0.048 = 22.3

New Zealand's death rate appears to be about 22 times higher.

Some estimates put the death rate for 20-40 year olds around 0.1%, and given the overwhelming majority of cases in Singapore fall into this age group that can probably explain a 10 fold difference between Singapore and New Zealand. I don't see why differences in healthcare, testing and a myriad of other variables we aren't aware of can't explain the remaining two fold difference.

"No, context matters a lot. 1 death in 100k makes sense in this extreme exceptional case. You can’t just take data at face value alone and determine if it’s “right” or “wrong”. 

Once you consider that most of these cases were actually mostly asymptomatic-mildly symptomatic migrant workers (healthy people medically certified to be well before they took up the job), and were relatively closed off from the wider community thus preventing transmission to vulnerable groups like in nursing homes, then it makes a whole lot of sense that there shouldn’t even be that many deaths. The government put the dorms in lockdown the moment this became an issue, and then aggressively *tested everyone inside regardless of symptoms repeatedly* over months. 

It’s like all the young people partying and being fine in many other countries - but the screw up comes when they bring the virus home to their parents, or interact with the rest of their community to pass it to their elderly neighbours or even the nursing homes. These migrant workers are like those healthy kids, but they didn’t bring the virus anywhere except among themselves for the most part so the screw up step didn’t happen. 

And for those who do fall sick and end up in hospital? They get the same care just like any other covid patient - the prime minister made it clear that they will be treated the same as a citizen. The problem in the US is that there aren’t even enough ventilators going around because of the massive load for instance - Singapore meanwhile has plenty to spare since the hospitals never got anywhere close to overwhelmed. So people also likely don’t die from covid when they end up in hospital because there is more than enough resources available to keep them alive even if they end up in ICU. The standard quality of care can be comparable to that of the US - the difference lies in the workload. 

Basically, if you died of covid in Singapore, you likely already had way too many other health complications that covid was simply the final straw to tip you over the edge. It’s not like in most places where covid swept through the vulnerable demographics and easily claimed a bunch of lives. It is an extreme outlier case, and can justify the ridiculously low death rate. 

If anything, it proves that having a quality healthcare system and a competent government working together could’ve saved a bunch of lives that were lost last year.",2021-02-11 23:01:57

"Let me assist with a source. Here is our Ministry of Health's website:

[https://www.moh.gov.sg/](https://www.moh.gov.sg/)

Every day, there is a full report on every single community-detected case, the location, the date, the transmission method, etc. Names are of course omitted. You can see all this for yourself.

If you got COVID and your case was not reported, you would immediately know they hid your case and the alternative news media would very likely get your case known. This has not happened.

The same site also states the contact tracing and those who were possibly exposed.

If you ask why there are so few severe cases, it is mostly because of very early detection and treatment.

In the early stages of the pandemic, getting any two of the symptoms would require a doctor to summon a team to quarantine their patient and be sent for testing. If positive, immediately afterwards every single person they were in close contact with with would be tested, **multiple times**. You immediately get medication and treatment, and in most cases it is free. The odds of dying from COVID in Singapore are very small because the hospitals are not overloaded and every patient gets their own private ward, with round-the-clock observation.

If you are wondering if the government is doing this because it cares for its citizens, please don't kid yourself. They do this for our national reputation and to keep the business community confident. Transparency is the way to people's trust, not propaganda.",2021-02-11 10:26:30

>Or it could be that early on we didnt know how to treat and therefore did harmful treatments

The only 'harmful treatment' we did early on was putting people on ventilators too quickly, and not turning them on their sides. This was specific to Coronavirus patients.

HCQ was never a harmful treatment.

Basically: the US has done an appalling job of handling the pandemic.",2021-02-11 08:53:50
"European countries have by-and-large decided to try to manage the disease through restrictions and on and off lockdowns. Frequently specifiying dates for restrictions to end in advance, and having to amend those dates later. All this creates confusion, uncertainty, and eats away at trust in institutions, as well as wrecking the economy though constantly changing conditions, and restrictions on how service industries can operate.

Inevitably people see the restriction and lockdowns failing to control the virus, and they view the restrictions as not worthwhile, for the amount of pain they cause, and see the virus as less significant compared to the toll lockdowns take. 

But looking at New Zealand, my home country, we had clear messaging, rules, and when the government didn’t know something, they told us. They also provided job security, and good unemployment coverage, to keep people employed. Our borders were also closed (mostly), so that no new cases could enter.

For example: when we locked down we got 
- a minimum time-frame 
- a review point - at which we would know if the lockdown was working
- a timeframe that told us how long the lockdown would last if we were successful (due to everyone doing their bit)
-and a disclaimer that the end date was unknowable.

Everyday, there were broadcast briefings featuring the prime-minister, and Covid-response head. 

With this system we had the confidence no one would starve or be made homeless. We cooperated with the rules. And our strict lockdown eliminated transmission. Once the lockdown was over, we could essentially return to normal life. 

Now we, as a population, know the lockdowns work, are effective, and necessary. But any undue suffering was avoided by our government stopping the virus as quickly as possible, And waiting until it was completely under control, to ease up on restrictions. If another lockdown is required, we will do it again, but we know it’ll work, and our government is doing it for a good reason - even if it sucks.  

Our economy has faired better than many of those in Europe. And we’re back to normal life - unlike almost every other country in the world. [source](https://www.ft.com/content/b8c4ab58-99db-4af2-9449-5fd70a9235ce)

TL;DR: (many of) the governments of Europe pretended to know things they couldn’t, were internally inconsistent, failed to provide clear rules and protections for their people, and kept their borders open. All this has contributed to their failure to manage the virus. All for fear of economic damage that would have been better managed by eliminating the virus.",2021-02-11 09:38:31

"The NYT link is behind a paywall, but yes Daniel Andrews did put in a part of Australia under lockdown for  12  weeks and for good reason, as the virus had started spreading and killing people. Now that's over, and the country is free to walk about, confident that the virus is under control.  We aren't losing 20,000 people a day to covid deaths.  A short term lockdown and our entire country is back to normal. 

I understand you don't care if people die as long as you can do what you want. Your freedom is worth the price of half a million deaths and counting, if you are from America. 

We kept our people safe while under lockdown. We gave them a good living allowance if they couldn't work. We gave businesses subsidies to help them continue to employ people.

And it was a sound economic decision. In my industry, businesses are moving their business from overseas back to Australia because we are seen as stable and safe. A brief hard lockdown helped us get ourselves back to normal quickly. We introduced online forums and activities to.support people's mental health and to ensure people still connected as best they could during the lockdown. 

We prevented an overload of our hospital systems and prevented the deaths of our medical professionals.

I do not understand why you would object to this, when the alternative is horrifying and demonstrated across the world.

With regards to your concerns about free speech in Australia, I share your concerns. It's worse than that article indicates. And it is getting worse. However at present we are not at the China level, and we can still object to what our government is doing.

However, the is a big difference between applying scientific principles to save the country from death, and silencing free speech. One is appropriate and one isn't.",2021-02-11 09:55:20

"While your suggestions are nice... It has a rollover effect in other sectors that affects us more immediately - for example, are you ready to pay 50% more for your BTOs at a longer waiting period due to fair wages and humane working hours? Even at its ""exploitative"" stage now, we are already complaining it's too expensive and takes too long. Realistically speaking, do we even have Singaporeans who would want to take up these occupations considering the high risk, nature of work environment and skills required? We can't even get enough young hawkers to join, and now you want them to weld, screed, plaster, clear debris, scale scaffolds in an even more unbearable condition than hawker centres?  
  
A closer case study would be Australia, which has one of the highest construction costs in the world. On the other hand, their workers are mostly locals, very highly skilled, takes pride in work, and are extremely fairly paid.  
  
So I think the solution can't be something so simplistic. Foreign labour is inherently a neutral term. The exploitative nature can be eliminated if we make sure builders AND developers play a larger role in fair employment. Right now, it's just builders being held responsible and given demerit points for work safety issues - nothing about their housing condition, work environment, fair and prompt wages, fair and prompt medical attention. Moreover, developers are so insulated from all these that when a new project goes out for tender, demerit points of a builder is almost never a point of consideration.  
  
TL;DR: I'm not saying it's great now (in fact, I'm agreeing it's bad). But the solution can't be as simplistic as saying we must replace all foreign labour. There is economic benefit for both parties. The exploitative nature can be eliminated if more parties are held responsible for their workers' lives.",2020-04-09 22:34:17

Ifpology


Attorney and business ethics expert Lauren Bloom, author of The Art of the Apology, mentions the ""if apology"" as a favorite of politicians, with lines such as ""I apologize if I offended anyone"". Comedian Harry Shearer has coined the term Ifpology for its frequent appearances on ""The Apologies of the Week"" segment of Le Show.[12]

One of the first references was in The New York Times by Richard Mooney in his 1992 editorial notebook ""If This Sounds Slippery ... How to Apologize and Admit Nothing"". This was mainly in regard to Senator Bob Packwood: ""Only in the event that someone should choose to take offense, why then he's sorry"". Mooney goes on to cite Bill Clinton, who said of Mario Cuomo: ""If the remarks on the tape left anyone with the impression that I was disrespectful to either Governor Cuomo or Italian-Americans, then I deeply regret it."" A famous example involved racially insensitive remarks made by golfer Fuzzy Zoeller about Tiger Woods; Zoeller's comments and his half-hearted ifpology were news for days and resulted in his being dropped from a commercial tie-in with K-Mart.[13] According to John Kador in Effective Apology, ""Adding the word if or any other conditional modifier to an apology makes it a non-apology.""[14]

A 2014 ifpology was made by CNN's Don Lemon, who said, ""If my question to [Joan Tarshis] struck anyone as offensive, I am sorry, as that certainly was not my intention."" This was about a question during his interview with Joan Tarshis where he suggested biting a penis as a way to avoid being orally sexually assaulted.[15]

On September 16, 2015, Matt Damon made what Salon termed a ""non-apology"" apology when he said, ""I am sorry that [my comments] offended some people, but, at the very least, I am happy that they started a conversation about diversity in Hollywood.""[16] This was in reference to the backlash against Damon after he made comments about diversity to African American film producer Effie Brown on the September 13, 2015 debut of the HBO show Project Greenlight that were criticized as condescending.[17]",2020-04-10 21:42:58
"I like how you have twisted my own words from ""he admitted he fucked up"" to being an ""apology"". In no way shape or form, have I said he apologised. I said very clearly:

>At least they're willing to admit they fucked up.

And you should admit you did now too. Stop moving the goalpost of the discussion.",2020-04-10 21:48:48
"This is quite clear to me now. Unable to put forward a reasonable argument, you are left with only the option of attempting to change the meaning of your own words. If all along, an apology is not the same as admitting he fucked up to you, how come you only say it now and choose to (poorly) debate my earlier points? 

 Its ironic that in your next statement you accuse me of shifting the goal posts when you JUST did. Doesn't get any more hypocritical than that

No need to embarass yourself any further, we're done here",2020-04-10 21:52:00
"I've been more than reasonable. You just haven't been refuting my points equally.

I took directly from the source what he said as evidence of he admitted there was a lack of foresight. You twisted my words into ""he expressed he lacked information"" .

Where is your basis to the claim he lacked information? Instead you moved the goalpost to discussing whether he apologised. You do know its possible to claim responsibility for an action right?

Also when I gave a proper reasonable reply to your 3rd comment, you gave me a Wikipedia article to what a nonapology is.

If you can't debate, don't start one. I'm not going to reply to someone who can't even debate based on the stance he started out with and is rooted in no concrete evidence while demanding the same out of the counterparty.",2020-04-10 21:59:37

"> # Covid-19 taskforce to test all 300,000 plus migrant workers in dormitories: Lawrence Wong

> The Covid-19 multi-ministry taskforce is planning to test all 300,000 plus migrant workers in dormitories, the Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong stated at a press conference on May 12.

> More than 3,000 migrant workers are tested daily

> With regard to the current rate of testing, more than 3,000 workers in the dormitories are tested daily, with a total of over 32,000 migrant workers tested thus far, according to a press release by the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> The press release highlighted that many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested, and that MOH plans to increase the rate of testing over time.

> Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said that ""progress"" was being made:

> ""For the situation in the migrant worker dormitories, we are making progress in clearing, testing the workers. We are committed to testing all the workers to make sure that they are free from infection.""

> 20,000 workers to be ready for discharge by the end of May

> He added that the rationale for doing so was to ""ensure that we are thorough and systematic cleaning up, and clearing the dorms, and verifying the status of all the workers before they resume work.""

> Wong said that about 20,000 migrant workers will be ready for discharge by the end of May, given that many of them were recovering well.

> ""It's also very encouraging to see that many workers are recovering well, they’re well on the road to recovery and many are ready for discharge. So by the end of this month we will have 20,000 who are ready for discharge, and then likewise in June we expect to see many more recovering and well on their way to being discharged and being able to resume work as well.""

> How will testing be carried out?

> As for the manner in which testing will be carried out, Wong stated that this will be done through mass polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, as well as mass serological tests.

> With regard to PCR tests, MOH stated that this is the test which has been relied on thus far to diagnose if someone is infected with Covid-19 in Singapore, and is the globally accepted testing standard.

> As for serological tests, these are used to detect antibodies to Covid-19 from a blood sample, as a marker of past infection.

> MOH further added that people who have been infected by Covid-19 for more than 10 to 14 days ago will have a positive serology test.

> As such, serological testing will be applied to dormitories with a higher rate of infection.

> Every migrant worker will be subjected to at least one of the tests

> Should a migrant worker have a positive serological test, this will mean that he has been infected at least 10 to 14 days ago.

> It will also mean that he will no longer be infectious after a period of isolation.

> Meanwhile, migrant workers in dormitories with a lower rate of infection will be subjected to a PCR test.

> Workers who have a negative result from either of these two tests, however, will be isolated for 14 days before being subjected to another PCR test, to confirm that they test negative for Covid-19.

> The 14-day isolation is necessary as a test before the 14th day will not be able to exclude the possibility of the disease developing at a later point.

> Number of cases remain high, asymptomatic cases are also being tested

> With regard to the high number of cases reported, Wong stated that this was due to the high number of tests being carried out.

> However, the high numbers were not indicative of the rate of new infections in dormitories, as the number reporting acute respiratory symptoms had fallen.

> Wong said:

> ""If you look at the actual numbers of people who report sick with acute respiratory illness, that number has been coming down by the day, compared to the peak of the outbreak. But every day, in terms of the reported cases, you will still see high numbers. That's because we are continuing to test many workers, including the ones who are asymptomatic and well, because this is part of our process to clear the dormitories systematically.""

The second statement offers a scarier prospect: how many asymptomatic are there as silent carriers?,2020-05-12 21:08:18
"Scary? It's just more evidence that the fatality rate is not as high as we thought, especially among the younger demographic.",2020-05-13 02:07:18
"How do you figure 75%? It says here that they are testing \~3000 workers daily. And we have \~750 positives a day, so that should be \~25% positive rate.",2020-05-12 21:41:35
"Probably gonna be cheap based on scale. Plus we aren't the US, there's no tolerance for inflated pharmaceutical prices",2020-05-13 17:19:53
"Come think of it, whichever way it is, it looks like they will end up with more than 50% of the total infected. I guess they’re overwhelmingly young but I hope the task force moves all 45+ olds to a separate location",2020-05-12 21:26:28
Hopefully the virus is mutating to become less deadly,2020-05-12 21:14:11
">The press release highlighted that many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested,

They are testing many without symptoms as well, and thus spotting some (many?) of the asymptomatic infected.",2020-05-12 21:43:37
"We don’t really have a mortality rate yet with the majority of people still in treatment. I more mean how contagious this is. Mortality will be way higher in the general public and if transmission rate is so high it is more likely to come back. And Singaporeans often live in multi-generation households, which is amazing for all purposes except this one....",2020-05-13 09:29:19
"The fatality rate for the those younger than 70 is 0.08% according to a recent Belgium study.

So yes, all the initial reports of 3%-5% death rates are pretty much complete BS.

"Only BS here is your opinionising. If the death rate depends on an external variable and you don’t control for this then of course it’ll vary once you do control. And I have no clue from what “study” on Facebook you have pulled the 0.08% (one in 1200). 

But official German figures (with Germany being the country, by a large margin, that tests the most) show that if this held true even for below 60 year olds they would have to have > 400k infected people under 60. They don’t. If we include the 60-70 year olds it would require more than 1mn infected people.",2020-05-13 09:26:31
"Something's weird with the numbers. If they've tested only 32k so far, and the worker testing rate has been 3k a day recently, that could have been done in the past 11 days. Sure, the testing rate was probably a bit lower a week ago, but that should still have been 2k a day or something like that. The dorm situation has been going on for 5-6 weeks, so 32k tested seems too few, especially vs 22k infected.

ETA: And  [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19)  says that 123 k unique people have been tested as of 4th May. Surely most of these should be dorm workers?",2020-05-12 21:51:13

* they use an entire tested base of <10k individuals to estimate the number of infected people in a country of multiple millions. 

This isn’t bad science. You add all this information including the caveats in a scientific paper and it becomes comparable with other similarly inferred numbers and that’s good science.

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 120 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday (Apr 5), the biggest daily increase since the outbreak began here in January, bringing the national total to 1,309.

> Four of the new cases are imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A ""significant number"" of the new cases are linked to existing clusters involving two workers' dormitories, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan, said the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force in a press conference.

> S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has 22 new cases and Westlite Toh Guan has 10 new cases.

> 2 DORMS GAZETTED AS ISOLATION AREAS

> Given these figures, the Ministry of Health has gazetted the two dormitories as isolation areas.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A total of 19,800 workers across the two dormitories have been placed under quarantine and will have to stay in their rooms for the next 14 days.

> Meals will be provided for the workers, as well as healthcare supplies including masks, thermometers and hand sanitiser, said the task force.

> Further safe distancing measures will also be implemented at all other worker dormitories, including staggering of meal times and minimising the inter-mingling of workers.

> However it should be made clear that foreign workers do not inherently have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> ""It's not an issue of targeting a particular group, they are not of higher risk,"" said Mr Wong.

> ""The issue we have here is foreign worker dorms have now emerged as a cluster of infection, a new vector for transmission, despite the precautions we have taken.""

> Meanwhile the authorities are readying the Singapore Expo as a community care facility, according to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

> ""The Singapore Expo is being prepared as the next community care facility,"" he told reporters.

> These facilities are meant for housing patients who have more or less recovered but who could still be infectious, he added.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had on Friday announced heightened safe distancing measures to act as a “circuit breaker” to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> Under the enhanced measures which will kick in next week, schools and workplaces – except those running essential services – will be closed for nearly a month until May 4. Food establishments will stay open only for takeaways or delivery.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday a third round of support measures will be rolled out to help businesses and households tide through these unprecedented “circuit breaker” measures.

> The “Solidarity Budget” will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday and comes less than two weeks after Mr Heng unveiled a record-breaking S$48 billion supplementary Budget.

> About a quarter of patients aged 13 and above diagnosed with an acute respiratory infection (ARI) from July 1 to Aug 16 declined a Covid-19 swab test, with some citing fear of discomfort.

> Since July 1, it has been a policy for all patients aged 13 and above who are diagnosed with ARI to be offered the swab test for the virus when they first see a doctor, as part of efforts to support more active case-finding in the community.

> Responding to queries from The Straits Times, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said that patients who decline the swab test are given a five-day medical certificate, during which they are legally required to stay at home.

> If a doctor assesses that a patient meets the suspect case definition of Covid-19, or has prolonged ARI at the end of the five-day period, the patient is legally required to go for a swab test.

...

> The ministry said it urges everyone to be socially responsible, and that those who are unwell - particularly those with mild symptoms of fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and loss of smell - should see a doctor promptly, and go for a swab test when their doctor tells them to do so.

> 3 Min Read.SINGAPORE - Nearly half of Singapore&#039;s migrant workers residing in dormitories have had COVID-19, according to the government, indicating the virus spread much more widely among those living in these accommodations than the official case tally shows.

> Authorities are still completing serology tests for about 65,000 workers living in dormitories who have not taken them before.

> While most countries only do serology testing on a sampling basis to estimate the prevalence of infections in a population, Singapore is conducting them on all the migrant workers living in the dormitories.

"Except they didn't die. Singapore's strategy was focused on minimizing deaths, not minimizing infections. When the outbreak hit, older workers and those with medical conditions were evacuated from the dorms. The total death toll to date is 29, that's a 0.05% case fatality rate. If you include these latest numbers that are based on serological studies (i.e., mostly asymptomatic cases), the infection fatality rate is 0.02%.

"Just a random thought: Out of the 50k+ dorm cases, how many of them might be false positives?

Could there also be false positive dormitory residents who only became infected towards the end of their 21 days stay at quarantine facilities, and then allowed back out of quarantine?",2020-12-11 17:38:45
How would they be infected? 21 days in a room leh.,2020-12-11 20:29:44
"First question, probably tens of false positives.

Second question, hard to answer as we don’t know how often the workers are tested while in community care facilities, whether asymptomatics are segregated from symptomatics, whether they are housed separately from negative workers for some time after discharge. I only know that those discharged on the basis of 21 days have to rest at “home” (dorm) for another week before working.

I would like to think that after the guy tests positive and is moved to e.g. Expo, seeing that he is completely asymptomatic, they would re-test him after a few days and find him negative. Then knowing that there’s a possibility of false positive, they might check him for antibodies and find that he has none i.e. he probably didn’t just recover and is likely false positive. Then because he was exposed at Expo, he would be moved to an individual room for 14-day quarantine.",2020-12-12 08:59:09
"Some are at large scale community quarantine facilities if they are not showing symptoms, like the ones at Expo. I believe they leave their cubicle to use shared toilet and collect food.",2020-12-11 21:12:23

> As some jobs “may never return”, Mr Heng urged mid-career professionals to consider changing industry and taking pay cuts to put themselves “in a better footing” after the crisis.

> The COVID-19 pandemic has dragged Singapore’s economy into its most severe downturn since independence, as the Ministry of Manpower recorded 11,350 retrenchments in the first half of the year.

> According to the ministry, this is higher than the 10,120 recorded during the SARS period, but still lower than other recessionary peaks.

> On Thursday, the Transport Ministry also announced that Singapore and Hong Kong have reached an in-principle agreement to establish a bilateral air travel bubble.

> This means that those travelling under the bubble will have no restrictions on their travel purpose and will not need to have a controlled itinerary. Travellers will also not be subject to quarantine or stay-home notice requirements.​​​​​​​

> However, travellers will need to test negative on mutually recognised COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. They will also be required to go on flights dedicated for those travelling under the bubble.

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 399 new cases; 69 more dormitories cleared

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily reported 399 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Tuesday (21 July) noon, taking the total to 48,434.

> Of the new cases, nine – including one Singapore resident – are classified as cases in the community, while three are imported cases who had been placed on stay home notice upon their arrival here.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are nine cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean and eight are work-pass holders,” said the MOH.

> “In addition, there are three imported cases who had been isolated or placed on Stay-Home Notice upon arrival in Singapore.

> “The higher number of cases today is mainly due to a batch of test results from the previous day reported to MOH after the 12pm cut-off for yesterday’s reporting.”

> More details will be provided later tonight, it added.

> Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a media release on Tuesday that 69 more dormitories have been cleared of COVID-19. These comprise three purpose-built dormitories (PBD), 59 factory-converted dormitories and seven construction temporary quarters.

> In addition, 41 blocks for recovered workers (BRWs) in 11 PBDs have been cleared. The 41 BRWs cleared include the remaining blocks in Tampines Dormitory, Cochrane Lodge 1, Cochrane Lodge 2, Changi Lodge 2 and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> This takes the total number to 891 dormitories and 56 BRWs in 17 PBDs cleared of COVID-19. In particular, Sungei Tengah Lodge is the largest PBD with around 16,000 workers, all of whom can immediately return to work if their employers have obtained approval from their sector agencies to restart operations.

> As of Monday, about 247,000 workers have either recovered, or have been tested to be free from the virus. Some of the workers are pending movement to appropriate accommodations before they can resume work. Others can return to work once dormitory operators, employers and workers have made the necessary preparations to minimise the risk of new infections as the workers go to work on a daily basis.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 285 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Monday, 44,371 cases – some 92 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while none are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Some 3,454 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 27 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 15 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 13 July, the ministry has conducted 1,009,532 swab tests, of which 519,911 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 177,100 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 91,200 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

\- from MOH's afternoon [press release on 14 Jul](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/347-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-14jul)

The current rise in the number is due to the ""targeted testing of migrant workers completing their isolation period"".

Hi, I've added columns for newly confirmed cases (in a period) and tested positive rate (number of newly confirmed cases / number of unique person swapped x 100% ) as per your suggestion. Is this what you meant?

Although it might be somewhat indicative of how Singapore is doing (controlling the spread of COVID-19), this number might also be influenced by many other factors, such as how testing is conducted.

E.g how many blind/random testing are done + how many ""targeted testing"" of high risk groups (people working in healthcare frontline or staying in dorms that are uncleared for COVID).",2020-07-22 11:45:35

> SINGAPORE: The Government will construct new foreign worker dormitories as part of plans to reduce the current density in these accommodations.

> 

> By the end of this year, the authorities will create additional space to house about 60,000 workers, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a joint media release on Monday (Jun 1).

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These include Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs) that can be constructed “quite quickly” in a modular form with a low density. These QBDs can last for about two to three years and can house about 25,000 people in total.

> Eight sites have been earmarked for new QBDs by the end of 2020, including in Kranji, Tuas, Admiralty, Choa Chu Kang and Tampines.

> 

> Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be fitted out temporarily to house about 25,000 workers, and the authorities are talking to contractors to build more construction temporary quarters, which are makeshift dormitories that keep the workers near their worksite.

> 

> Some of the state properties that will be refurbished include the former Bedok North Secondary School building, the former Anderson Junior College Hostel and tents at the National Service Resort and country club in Kranji.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As part of longer-term plans, the Government is planning to build new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) over the next few years that can house up to 100,000 workers. These dormitories, which will have amenities such as minimarts and barber services, will replace the temporary accommodations built this year.

> 

> About 11 PBDs will be ready in the next ""one to two years"", the media release said. Workers living in the PBDs will also have ready access to medical care and support.

> 

> ""With these additional PBDs in place, we will also have the capacity to decant

> workers from the existing dormitories, and to undertake major upgrading to these

> dormitories to ensure that they meet the new standards,"" the ministries said.

> Besides expanding housing availability for foreign workers, government agencies are developing a set of specifications for these new dormitories, the ministries added.

> 

> These specifications will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.

> 

> “In land scarce Singapore, dormitories are a practical approach to housing our migrant workers,” the media release said.

> 

> “We aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks including pandemics, with improved living standards that are benchmarked both domestically and internationally.

> 

> “We will take on board lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic, and also seek feedback from relevant stakeholders.”

> 

> Some of the present set of standards that will be improved as part of a pilot include increasing the living space per resident from a minimum of 4.5 sqm per resident, including shared facilities, to at least 6 sqm, not including shared facilities.

> 

> There will also be a maximum occupancy rate of up to 10 beds per room. Currently, there are no limits - the ministries noted that in practice, there are about 12-16 beds in each room.

> 

> The new set of requirements will see only single-deck beds being used, with 1m spacing between the beds.

> More toilets and bathrooms will also be built so that there is at least one bathroom, sink and toilet for every five beds, instead of every 15 beds.

> 

> The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the new PBDs on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for the commercial operators to bid, build or operate.

> 

> ""While the physical standards are being improved, it is equally important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and make adjustments to the daily living habits of the dormitory residents,"" the ministries said.

> ""Everyone must do their part to minimise the risk of infection clusters. The pilot will therefore also seek to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.""

> The ministries noted that cost will go up alongside these new housing arrangements, “but they will keep the workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions"".

> 

> The media release also said that some of the dormitories will be located closer to residential areas given the country’s land constraints.

> ""Singaporeans must therefore do our part too. We must reject the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) mindset and instead appreciate these workers who keep Singapore going,"" the ministries said.

You want the gov to listen to the people or not?,2020-06-01 20:46:40
"Just out of curiosity (with no animosity or hostility against you), how would you propose going about improving the conditions without reducing the numbers of workers in a dorm?

I believe that this is the only realistic path seeing that reducing the number of people will reduce the strain on the common facilities (toilets, shower area etc etc), and reduce the amount of dirt being brought in from their work sites. There are also arguments that the reason that dorms are in their bad states is also partially due to their own habits and culture where what they consider as ""clean"" might not be ""clean"" to Singaporean standards. 

To combat this, relocating them to less dense dorms seems to be most logical sense in improving their living conditions. Less strain on the common facilities, easier to clean up due to the reduce in dirt/soil being brought from their sites.",2020-06-02 10:23:06
Just Google what happened when the govt converted a old school near serangoon gardens to a dorm,2020-06-01 21:23:55
"Not sure if you are referring to me when you say ""U act like having a dorm near u is some kind of blemish"" because I did not say nor infer that.

I'm asking the poster to just take a look at the Fb comments of the article. We are only at the planning stage and look at how bad the comments are. I personally have no issue with it. But the problem that the government is going to face is not with people like me, but those who only care about themselves. Gone are the comments of ""we have to treat the FW as humans, they must have living conditions as good as ours"" to ""why is the new FW dorm going to be near my place? I dont feel safe, too many people etc etc"".

There is a large group of Singaporeans out there that will only stand up for something as long as they dont feel the effects of it. The moment the government comes up with something that they have to compromise of, all hell breaks loose.",2020-06-01 21:58:33
"One possible way is to reduce the reliance on foreign workers. Of course the counter argument is that it is easier said than done. I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy. However, do we need such a huge amount of them ? Or are they here because corporations want them here to maximise their profits ?  When we were in the early 2000s they were here mainly for construction and S&CC services. However, more and more came to roles such as building maintenance and marine services. I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.

In the view of improving living conditions, it might be necessary to build more dormitories but they could still be built at areas where the population doesn’t resides. If we have to settle them at offshore facilities or floating dormitories then so be it. Also, cleanliness of shared areas could be enforced. I wouldn’t dare to make the assumption that their living spaces is same as what the SAF provides but I would dare to say that it is at least comparable. Why are shared areas and living spaces in bunks way better than what the FWs are living in ? I think it boils down to discipline. Some SAF bunks have 8 double decker beds in a single room and yet the area is still clean af. The question is, are they committed to clean up after their own? It doesn’t matter how much space we give them at the end of the day. If they don’t bother to give a fuck about their own area, no one can help them isn’t it ?",2020-06-02 11:08:17
"No, i didnt mean u. It was rhetoric. Sorry.",2020-06-01 22:00:14
"For your first point, I think you've deviated from the kind of foreign workers that is being discussed. We're not talking about FW who are in the building maintenance and marine services, but rather the FW who are working in construction, waste disposal, house renovation etc etc. FW who are working in building maintenance and marine services most likely have their own apartments. There is no way Singaporeans would want to do the job that the FW who lives in dorms do (construction, grass cutting, road resurfacing 6 times a week etc etc)

For your second point, yes I believe that culture and mindset does play a part in the current condition of the dorms. However, there is also so much ""trash"" (for a lack of better word ) a person can create. By reducing the number of people, it brings down the total amount of ""trash"", making it easier to clean up (or cleaners to clean if they contracted any). Short-term solution would be to built these temporary dorms, long term solution would be to educate them on cleanliness and hygiene.",2020-06-02 22:20:36

To clarify - I'm not saying that it's right. I'm saying that you cannot just dismiss such people as though they don't mean anything.

"Your proof is right in this thread, and unfortunately, they might not be small in numbers.",2020-06-02 11:10:55
"Didn't need proof, lol. It was inevitable. 

Society is a hot mess of discombobulating, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. And the bottom line is everyone has a voice, everyone is able to influence the outcome. It's simultaneously empowering and discouraging. 

Back in 2011, the influx of foreign labour was the, if not one of the largest, election issue. It cost the PAP a talented Foreign Minister (oh - and a GRC. Whatever). Since 2011 you can track a very clear and blunt shift in policy, focused on keeping FWs away from the public eye. The Little India Riots didn't help, and the public furor only cemented the policy turn as being the right thing to do (if only to avoid public outrage). 

Now, one can persist in laying that at the feet of the PAP, saying that's the PAP abdicating moral responsibility, etc. But another can also make the argument that the PAP was simply following their democratic mandate and listening to the people. *I find it very hard to accept any denial that the voters back in 2011 had a hand in creating the standard of living that FWs experience now*.  

Consequently, while I applauded the outpouring of goodwill to the FWs in the Covid saga, the inevitable pushback was inevitable. Because society is a hot mess. 

My response above was to the comment that we can simply ignore these people, that their views are inconsequential because they're ""wrong"". No. We can't. That's not how democracy works. They will have their voice. There will be an opposition party who will, under the temptation of quick and easy votes, champion their cause. And if none of the existing opposition parties are stupid enough to take up that flag, the likelihood of them creating their own opposition party to raise that voice only increases. 

It is inevitable. The only way we have forward is to continue to show that they are a misguided minority in our society, and their views do not hold water in dictating how the country decides to treat FWs.",2020-06-02 15:17:48

"> # Singapore reports a record 287 new COVID-19 cases with more than half linked to dormitory cluster

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).

> This brings the national tally to 1,910.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.

> A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said.

> 

> Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.

>

> Advertisement

> The task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II and Toh Guan Dormitory.

> Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.

> ""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.

> ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.

> 

> Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added.

> Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.

> Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.

> The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.

> On Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.

> This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.

> This came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.

> About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.

> People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.

> First-time offenders will get a stern written warning. Anyone who commits a second offence will be fined S$300, while a third offence will lead to the person being charged in court.

"> # 558 of 623 new coronavirus cases in Singapore are foreign workers from dormitories

> SINGAPORE - Foreign workers staying in dormitories make up 558 of the 623 new Covid-19 cases on Friday (April 16), the Ministry of Health said in its second update on infection numbers of the day.

> The other patients are 27 community cases and 37 work permit holders who did not stay in dormitories. There is also one imported case. This brings Singapore's total count to 5,050 coronavirus cases.

> MOH announced four new virus clusters as well.

> S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Singapore's largest cluster, added another 144 patients and is now linked to more than 1,000 cases.

> MOH said that it was also concerned that it is increasingly difficult to link the new cases and identify the source of infection.

> The ministry said the number of unlinked cases in the community has increased slightly, from an average of 19 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 22 per day in the past week.

> ""We have an ongoing surveillance programme, where a small sample of patients at our primary care facilities are tested for Covid-19 infections,"" said MOH.

> ""We have picked up some cases through these tests, which is an indication of undetected cases in the community.""

> Earlier in the day, MOH released preliminary figures ahead of its usual evening announcement. It is not clear why it decided to do so but there were messages circulating earlier that Singapore had logged the biggest single-day spike of 1,146 on some online platforms.

27 community cases and 37 work permits outside dorms. Aren't the WP ones outside dorms community transmissions as well?,2020-04-18 00:39:45
Wow we are so easy to be comforted by the way figures reported.,2020-04-18 08:56:08
all about massaging the numbers,2020-04-18 01:29:36
"So IBs can say it's not ""local"" spread.",2020-04-18 00:28:56
"Yes, this part is super interesting especially as the Situation Report is now breaking the prevalence down by these groups too.

So as far as I can work out they are separating work permit holders out and then sub-dividing that into dorm / non-dorm.

Then others count in the community cases. What they don't really explain is what these groups include. So lets take the Situation Report population at risk numbers, Dorms - 323,000 / Non-dorm 664,000 = total 987,000

That number nicely matches up with the June 2019 numbers here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/documents-and-publications/foreign-workforce-numbers Work permit total = 981,000

The interesting thing though is that those numbers include FDW permits which would seem to be the definition of residents in the 'community'.

So as far as I can work out community cases include citizens, PRs and Pass Holders (EP/SPass/PEP/Student Dependents Social etc)

Work Permits group contains 323,000 in dorms, 255,800 FDWs and then another block of 408,200 Work permit holders that do not live in dorms. 

So the only thing that really ties this remaining group together is that according to work permit rules it's the employer that is responsible for providing housing for these workers (and in a way I guess that's technically the case with FDWs).

So a theory for this is that there's a fairly fluid definition of what is and what isn't a Dormitory and sure enough the MOM helps us out again here: https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing

So maybe the missing piece of the puzzle here is the large block of construction workers who are allowed to be housed in temporary quarters and these are not being counted as 'dormitories' 

If this is the case (and the numbers seem to tally somewhat) then the only problem I can see is that the 255,000 FDWs being included in this group are reducing the prevalence in the non-dorm group.",2020-04-18 11:12:21
"So that numbers look lower. 27 and 37 vs. 64.

Psychological impact is less. Imagine when it hits triple digits. Nicer to say (for example) 48 and 68 vs. 136.",2020-04-18 00:48:12
its a game called statistics,2020-04-18 00:27:46
"I suspect (could be so wrong) but a majority of these work pass cases could be the result of contact tracing from dorms. Community cases are from people being sick and then are tested, whereas work pass cases would be a combination of contact tracing and individuals being sick.",2020-04-18 01:25:14
"saving face = more important than human rights

really, man? u disgust me.",2020-04-18 06:31:46
Yea most likely due to random testing.,2020-04-18 08:48:15
"this. surely, they cant be using many tests on locals rn.",2020-04-18 06:32:55
"I guess they're kinda in between. They might have had interactions with dorm workers when working or on off days. Not much is known about the profile of this group. Hard to say, might make sense to categorize them separately for now for trending purposes.",2020-04-18 01:45:54
"Trends for most landlords are they are absentee ones, with them living elsewhere with one locked rooms. The ones actuslly living in the flat or house are likely WP holders too.",2020-04-18 08:11:52
"It's a mixed bag. Malaysians work permit holders and those in the ""services category"" (e.g. PRC cooks and food court assistants) are allowed to rent HDBs.

But I suspect many of the non-dorm WP holders work in the same places (e.g. construction sites) as dorm workers and got infected by their colleagues. They may not have much contact with the wider Singapore community, other than taking public transport. Here are some examples of where they may live.

One [Chinese WP holder](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/two-work-permit-holders-charged-for-breaching-quarantine-order) was just charged with breaching quarantine , and the case details reveal that his company moved him from [45 Genting Lane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/45+Genting+Rd,+Singapore+349488/@1.3271431,103.8767154,3a,75y,43.13h,94.22t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sgHP537pVsohP_RgAFMacOQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m5!3m4!1s0x31da17877434104f:0xe976756926efcc3d!8m2!3d1.3274546!4d103.8767635) to [14 Genting Lane](https://www.google.com/maps/place/14+Genting+Rd,+Singapore+349475/@1.3282141,103.8752106,3a,75y,223.68h,120.99t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJyfg-Qfj5x9ZCudeJiDh7A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x31da1787230a7e47:0xabfcf08042e321cf!2s14+Genting+Rd,+Singapore+349475!3b1!8m2!3d1.3280172!4d103.8751087!3m4!1s0x31da1787230a7e47:0xabfcf08042e321cf!8m2!3d1.3280172!4d103.8751087). This is a light industrial area; the first appears to be a small number of rooms above a small contractor or warehouse, the second looks like a fairly new office building, but if you zoom in on the top floor, there are shirts hanging up to dry. 2 of the original 5 Bangladeshi construction workers at Seletar Aerospace Heights were reported to live in ""rental apartments"" at Veerasamy Road and Campbell Lane. These are probably shophouses similar to [this](https://www.google.com/maps/@1.3053455,103.8524711,3a,75y,56.64h,103.02t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1WS6p6-RXQnTAWptCdS3qQ!2e0!7i16384!8i8192).

"There's an 8-12 hour TAT depending on the hospital I believe. The countdown starts from either the time the sample is taken and logged in at the location, or the time it reaches the lab (also depends on the hospital protocol). So whoever comes in, local or FW, as long as the sample is taken on a particular day, it has to be finished within the 8-12 hour time frame. This is to reduce any backlog that might eventually overwhelm the lab.

I don't believe the protocol has changed yet because everyone I know is working 12 hour shifts in their respective labs.",2020-04-18 09:49:34

Frankly I don't see how Singapore can open up next week without some severe restrictions on movement and interactions with our FW. We are still testing positives in the hundreds each day in that segment.,2020-05-25 14:27:41
If all FWs lived in 1 big dorm than yes. Or you can look at that figure as an upper bound. However the 300k workers are spread across numerous dorms. There will be plenty of dorms which end up being completely spared and have no cases. These will the tested later in the process since they are lower priority for the 100% testing. Once we get there it should be expected that the overall FW infection rate decreases.,2020-05-25 23:04:17

Wonder y keep having ppl asking why mention foreigner Singaporean or PR... since I’m so free I use a little bit of brain and... no tourist infected so no mention of tourist/ local and PR meaning how many unlink case or ppl roaming ard within SGP/ foreign workers who live in the dorms are under quarantine (with gov doing their best). So we who read the news will Understand the situation in SGP. Prevent panic or rushing to supermarket. It’s just a news and reports... dun always look at things or pinpoint over small matters... life would be happier. Stay safe and healthy everyone!,2020-04-26 23:47:17+00:00

"Read this excerpt dated July 17, 2012 Vaccines Are Causing Mutations That May Jeopardize The Health of Future GenerationsVaccines are causing an unprecedented number of mutations creating superbugs and potent viruses and bacteria that may eventually threaten future generations and humanity itself. Evidence continues to mount from the scientific community who now admit that certain vaccines are in-fact causing both viral and bacterial mutations. Ironically, the same researchers assert that ""better"" vaccines are needed to offset the rise in persistent mutations.🇸🇬",2020-04-20 15:20:36+00:00

"Hope govt and employers will have a good review on living conditions inside the dorms. Cannot just push the responsibility to the workers living there. With proper facilities, education and respect we can definitely learn from this and do better. I always believe if the environment was properly managed or maintained, people will also do so. Someone needs to hear from the workers themselves their real conditions without fear of being fired  etc, gotta rethink how these are run and managed.",2020-04-20 10:55:57+00:00

"If the world continues to be in the lockdown mode then a great depression is inevitable! Please consider Jessica Seah's nontoxic method. I posted concrete proofs including a grandma and her 3 years old grandson reversed their H1N1 infection without any medication, no expensive ventilator is required. Jessica Seah's treatment method is cheap, simple and very effective. Our immune system is the best doctor and best defence against COVID 19, infections, diseases, pathogens, free radicals and cancer cells. I hope the world will not keep repeating the history of having to deal with new strains of superbugs caused by the man-made chemicals like medicines , vaccines, disininfectants, hand sanitizers, etc. The more such toxins are used, the more vulnerable will be the population will be to infections and diseases! Toxic man-made chemicals will not be part of having a healthy society. If people keep adding poison to our environment, the voiceless unborn foetuses will have birth defects and it will affect the quality of the future generations.

Im just very surprised you all say to protect the vulnerable groups from the virus. Why is mOH allowing TTSH to house covid patients in renci community hospital nursing block which holds chronic wards and other vulnerable wards? The bed crunch may be a real concern but why put a time bomb in the same block as nursing high risk vulnerable patients??? It takes just one leak to cause death to the already vulnerable group!,2020-05-09 01:34:31+00:00

"After CB, the government should not be using the criteria whether a biz is carrying out essential services to open in phase 1 or 2 or 3.

Shops have been closed for more than 2 months already. Rental and salaries still need to be paid. If shops are not allowed to open soon, all of us will be out of business.
