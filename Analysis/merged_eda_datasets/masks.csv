"> # Diners to wear masks when tossing yusheng, no 'shouting' of auspicious phrases: Lawrence Wong

> Those dining out during the CNY period should keep their face masks on during the tossing of yusheng, the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) announced in a press conference on Jan. 22, 2021.

> Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong said during the press conference that they had anticipated a greater level of transmission in Phase 3 due to the increased interactions in the community.

> ""Indeed, in the past two weeks, we have seen an increase in the number of locally-transmitted cases,"" Gan added, saying that some of these cases have resulted in community clusters.

> Given the situation, Covid-19 safe management measures will be tightened during the CNY period, including measures such as limiting the number households that a family should visit.

> Lohei practices

> Regarding dining out, the MTF said that face masks must not only be worn during the tossing of yusheng, but lohei should also be done without any verbalisation of auspicious phrases.

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong said, ""There should be no shouting of auspicious phrases by the F&B staff or by the patrons in the restaurant.""

> He also said that we have to be ""especially careful"" during this CNY period.

> F&B establishments and enterprises serving lohei must ensure that both the staff and patrons comply with these requirements.

> The maximum group size for social gatherings outside the house will remain at 8 people for now, but people are encouraged to keep their social circle small instead of mixing with multiple groups.

> Stepping up enforcement checks at F&B outlets

> There will also be more enforcement checks at F&B establishments, malls and other crowded public spaces during this period.

> Strict enforcement actions will be taken against individuals and operators who do not comply with safe management measure.

> The penalties include fines and prosecution in court, depending on the severity of the offence. For operators who do not comply with the measures, their operations will be suspended.

> Totally unrelated but follow and listen to our podcast here

As soon as that group of drinkers in Robertson Quay were caught, which was stupid and selfish behaviour for which I agree with the punishment, it led to a trend for groups of older Singaporeans to hang out by the river and take our pictures on the off chance that we were up to no good.

No

2)Is that person responsible for your happiness?
No

3) Is that person fair?
No

4) Does that person care about you or listen to you?
No

Besides, that person never wanted to make her happy or is a friend, no friends does that.

Once I had happily bought an ice cream from United square in novena and walked to novena sq via the nearby underpass which connects both novena square and novena mrt.

Happily minding my own business as I was going down the escalator slurping my ice cream when this guy asked at me from behind NO EATING IN THE TRAIN STATION!!!

In my mind I was like I am not eating in the train station. This is an underpass that connects to the train station but not the train station itself. I scolded him by shouting back this is not the train station there's no sign saying I can't. We had some unpleasant exchanges. He said he's an SMRT staff so he knows. If I wasnt in a rush, I would have brought him to the train station itself and hopefully have him scolded by the train station guys if he was an imposter.

End of the day I was right. Emailed SMRT and they replied underpass not part of train station

If it were me or any one of my local brown friends, we'd cuss his ass out and totally tell him to go back to China without inhibition (we'd cuss him in fluent Bahasa Kebangsaan, too, to see how he deals with it. Probably throw a lil ""pendatang"" in there while we're at it or tell him to stfu lest he infects us with the Wuhan), and we'd get a great kick out of it. Born-and-bred Malay and Indian Singaporeans don't have the same inhibitions that you may have when it comes to delivering a stinging rebuke to belligerent racists that provoke us because there isn't a power differential between us and the local racists (as opposed to the citizen > foreigner power differential which makes the latter less inclined to take a stand.)

"Man, I’ve experienced this too. Singapore is super welcoming and a multicultural country which welcomes all races, but there’ll always be that 1/50th man who will try his absolute best to kick out every foreigner from his country. Earlier this year, a fucking security guard of my own condominium yelled at my brother for having his mask down when cycling out. When my brother told him that you’re allowed to remove it while cycling, the bitch literally called him “a motherfucking Indian” and came ahead to physically assault him.

Yeah, we did report him and he got transferred out. But now he still works at a mall 500 meters away run by the same security guard agency. Having personally known every single security guard in the condominium, they were aware of the fact that we are friendly, outgoing people who wouldn’t unnecessarily pick fights.

This was during the lockdown, and the security guard was probably brought in from overseas due to a shortage of labor.

It is sad, but once in a blue moon, it does happen. What does relieve me is that, for every 1 in 50 idiots, there are 49/50 welcoming locals who’ll always smile and welcome foreigners for who they are.

Was at Parkway Parade, doing my business at the urinal in the toilet, when an old man (60+) quickly waddled in, already pissing all over the toilet floor, apologising about not being able to hold it in. What was funny was that the cleaner had literally just mopped the floor when I entered, he was still standing there when all of this happened.

Fast forward a few minutes, was heading to Tori-Q to buy lunch, when I saw the same guy walking towards me. That level 1 entrance/exit was divided into two for crowd control purposes so if you were along the entrance corridor you had to walk one big round to get to the exit corridor and leave.

u act like other races arent racist to chinese ppl in western countries? for example its notorious of black and asian communities to have tiffs. BUT there are always those that look pass their differences and bond together.  same as any other race. 

I find it disheartening u think in singapore its sinkie vs ""amdk"" ang moh big shot. ur blatantly discriminating against white ppl here. im not sure what bad experiences u have had but dont stereotype so many ppl of different backgrounds, social classes, values, personalities into ur own personal bad experience. 

im a half chinese half white American singaporean working a blue collar job having to speak chinese at a company where malay is the main language of communication, followed by chinese. I failed chinese in my o levels and the agent from a recruit company alr ripping 
me off lied to me it was english speaking when I  went from a horrible previous job with miscommunication and honestly bullying with chinese as the main language. why do I feel ashamed, scared to speak about experiences of me living in singapore as my race. why  do I feel better that I can come off as non white person because my features can look like a non white person too? 

u act like there arent singaporean big shots ? Malaysian big shots? Indian  big shots ? Chinese big shots? other country expat big shots etc;? I read there are singaporeans respected and high up the hierarchy of the cooperate world in other countries like Australia. on a post like this that is suppose to deter xenophobia, please refrain from a comment like urs spurring xenophobia towards white ppl in singapore. nothing good comes from judging a person based on a race. we cant and should not want to change the color of our skin, the features on our face, just because majority of the ppl decided that this particular minority group can be discriminated against. increasingly and scarily among young singaporeans white ppl are the easy to pick on group in singapore. theres so many reddit posts against white ppl, im worried for the future that we will find white ppl become even worse the scapegoat of discrimination but its fine cos for some reason ppl like to justify their racism with racism.


 I definitely dont want to come off as victimizing myself and excusing that ppl sometimes treat me badly because of my race. I want to always strive to be better, more understanding, communicative and productive, but I definitely have lapses in doing so. honestly think sometimes ppl are welcoming, intrigued and well responding. Ive been told I was attractive solely because im mix which is weird. its just im a reserved person that can come off as rude and anti social. its like if a singaporean etc chinese is like that its fine but for my race it ""stands out"" as stuck up or rude. my sibling was literally called ""hao lian yang ren"" for just stacking things on a shelf. what the fuck? its just been clicking in my mind that all these posts on reddit are revealing the true underlying (racist) feelings of singaporeans that can affect how they see a white person that deeply disturbs me.. my white American father  was abandoned by his parents and raised by his abusive uncle working on a farm. packed his bags and left at 18. faced a lot of racism and discrimination and got scammed a lot in asian countries even tho he was not well to do. his Sister was shot by a black man to steal her purse, (this really affected him because he was very close to her) . he got ganged up on and beaten by a group of black man for playing a game of pool in the wrong bar. I have to say this has influenced my thought process, I have no prejudice against black ppl, well by the definition ""Prejudice is an unjustified attitude or opinion, usually a negative one, directed toward an individual for something the individual cannot control"" I really try not to, but i get very annoyed by posts like these, I dislike the blm movement  that were about supporting george floyd heavy on drugs and stealing a pregnant lady things at gun point, ppl going around destroying white businesses and bullying white cops.
we always will want to one up each other, be smarter be better, or else u become the loser. I see that black ppl have had fought for their rights and rightfully taken it. and white ppl shouldnt stop to fight for theirs. either way in singapore at least u shouldnt be judged by race but by merit to build a democratic society, based on justice and equality, so as to achieve happiness prosperity and progress for our nation.",2020-12-22 15:23:48,reddit

"I mean, I did acknowledge that racism exists everywhere. Perhaps the most inclusive places (that I’ve heard of) would be NZ and Canada then. I guess I was very blessed that in the four years that I lived in Canberra, I didn’t really experience severe cases of racial discrimination. It could also be that Canberra tends to be a uni/student town, more educated, and the local families who live there are very comfortable with international students and actually reach out to us to make us feel at home while abroad. Been to Sydney many times on trips and it definitely doesn’t feel as “warm”. Sydney is just a big city like any other. The likelihood of there being racist people is just higher.

As for making white friends, I’ll agree that for me personally, I’m pretty introverted so I found it hard to get close with them (also I don’t enjoy clubbing so that’s a lot of social events in the hall that I missed out on haha). I definitely found it easier to connect with my Korean Australian friends etc. The caucasian aussie that was close to us grew up in Taiwan so culturally, we found it easier to connect with him, but he also made the extra effort to connect with international students. That’s not to say that white Aussies were unfriendly or racist; I have many extroverted SG friends who integrated with the (white) locals very well. I’d say that generally it does take more effort on both sides to reach out to make a connection. The people at the local church I joined really went the extra mile to help internationals feel at home in Canberra; they became our family for the years we were there.

"Late 90s and early oughts. I was there for all of my teens. I went back as part of work a few years ago when I still worked for a certain big yellow American heavy equipment company. The urban areas are slightly less racist. There is a huge international student bubble that you can get lost in and never have to see a local. The rural areas are even more racist than I remember. The problems with the Australian economy are even worse right now, even as the place has become a lot more prosperous for that sizable minority of people who have their fingers in real estate, agriculture and mining. If you are a property speculator, a miner or a farmer and have not found a way to rent seek off of these industry, Australia is going to be a terrible place. Extremely expensive with no opportunities.

The thing with the US is that there are an abundance of good schools. Many non brand name mid western schools count over a dozen nobel prize winners as their alumni. They have very strongly funded research programs such that you will have access to career enhancing research opportunities even as an undergraduate. The quality of instruction is typically very high at a good school. The thing with the US are so many of these schools that you will almost certainly get in to one of them as long as your grades are even slightly competitive.--Of course surviving to graduate may be a different matter, but the key thing is that if you are late bloomer and are willing to work hard, you can punch above expectations. I went in with good grades, but I feel that this is is a system that I strongly prefer over systems like Singapore's where there is all kinds of pointless and invented rationing of opportunities for the sake of elitism. There will be opportunities for you to participate in engineering design teams building cars aircraft and machinery for competitions. These teams tend be democratic in the US and open to everyone prepared to contribute, even those who are not engineering students.The research and the engineering teams I was part of made finding a job out of University very easy. It made finding internships in University relatively easy even though I was disadvantaged by the H1B visa nonsense.

 I heard from my Australian colleagues that Australian universities ration these opportunities for favored students and they are certainly not open to everyone. I invite you to take a look at your prospective university's formula student team. This is an important indicator even if you aren't planning to be an engineer. You will likely find that even as these Australian universities happily take your money, they will reserve the best opportunities for white students. This is true at all levels of Australian society The same is simply not true of the US. I still mentor my old student design teams. The leadership in my shell marathon team has had exactly 2 white guys in the last 10 years. Both this team and the FSAE team are majority non-white. Both team have recently been led by women. No one had to tell them to be diverse. There was no diversity program or any shit like that. Just being open to the contributions of people regardless of race made things this way.  I am very proud of this and would be very happy if my kids could go to the same school when they are older. 

The other advantage that choosing the US would have is that, unless you pick a university in downtown NYC or SF or LA, your cost of living is going to be hugely lower. Fees at a midwestern public University are comparable or lower than an Australian University. Many US college town have decent amenities and are near enough to have the big cities to make weekend trips feasible, but not near enough that you wind up paying over 500USD a month in rent even right now. Owning a used car is cheap and the US is sufficiently relaxed about tuning and so on that you can really get something cheap and fix it up into something nice. Working on your car there is seen as a human right. It is a very different environment to Singapore and you will find it to be a great opportunity to learn many new things and make friends that will follow you for a long time.",2020-12-20 03:05:37,reddit

From what I understand, the initial advice from the govt to not wear masks was because singaporeans were stocking up heavily on them, and this caused a shortage esp to those who really needed them (healthcare workers, those who were actually sick etc). That’s why our govt said to wear masks out only if we were sick (just in case it was COVID). Now that the shortage is more or less dealt with, and our local (and untraceable) cases here are increasing, the govt is saying to wear masks if we go out - as we may be asymptomatic carriers.

As we saw more cases and collected our own evidence of asymptomatic transmission, they probably knew a mask would be helpful, but likely didn't want to cause a frenzy by advocating masks when it was so difficult for the general public to buy any. They only made the announcement when they were ready to offer masks for every household.

Many people a month ago fought hard to say that measures to fight Covid-19 are measures against their livelihood. But, had we been proactive like Taiwan, we wouldn’t be in this state of DORSCON Pink, and many more livelihoods would have been saved than lost.

Had both the government and the people been proactive and take this seriously, we would have been like Taiwan and the economic impact reduced. Our government was reactive, and our entitled populace wasn’t serious, and here we are today, 142 cases a day and rising.",2020-04-09 11:24:07,reddit

"> Taiwan has strong manufacturing and their SMEs immediately produced lots of masks for their citizens.

Not just a case of 'immediately produced'. Back in Jan, when Taiwan got news of people having an unknown pneumonia + Chinese citizens snatching up masks and health supplies overseas, they went out to purchase mask-making equipment instead. The tensions across the Taiwan strait meant that Taiwan was very up to date, compared to other countries (minus Japan/US). The government eventually went to all the mask making factories, offered them the machines (for free, on conditions) and offered them extra manpower (their conscripts) to use the machines.

They recently donated 10 million masks to EU, US and other countries. That was less than a day of their production amount. There's also [news that they would be donating to 7-8 ASEAN countries, including Singapore](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202004070012).",2020-04-09 08:28:58,reddit

Even when announcing the new attitude towards wearing of masks in public, there was the name drop of WHO and also mention that studies show asymptomatic transmission is likely. The former is an appeal to authority, even though it's quite plain to see that WHO's response in the pandemic is lacking and slow. While the latter, waiting for concrete evidence before taking action is too reactive and slow, when one considers that the cost of the action (everybody mask up, even if not surgical) is relatively low compared to the consequence of the inaction. In other words, a proactive approach of getting everyone to mask up (even with cloth mask), when there's no strong evidence of asymptomatic transmission yet but one can infer that it's possible (for asymptomatic transmission) and that low symptom expressing infected may not wear masks if it's not normalised for everyone to wear it in public, might result in a circuit breaker being unnecessary now.

Many of us guess the same thing ba.

The appeal to international or superpower authority is just intellectually dishonest IMHO. I've seen over the years WHO, CDC and what other countries' say and do being used as a justification for various decisions. However, if one looks clearly, they're often merely cherry picking what backs their choices. Also, if one's choices are grounded in logic and evidence, there's no need to appeal to authority. Appeal to authority here is used to placate the masses, but also as a convenient scapegoat to blame when decisions turn out to be bad in hindsight.

> If they changed their stance early on, there just be a rush of hoarders. We don't want a situation like in the US or UK where the healthcare workers don't have PPE and are having to re-use them or MacGyver up their own plastic protection.

This is actually a moot point. The government controls the supply of surgical masks and rice. Hence, it's not possible for PPE for public healthcare workers or for food for emergency rationing to gone as a result of consumer hoarding.

---

What's important now is for the CB to work so we can regain some normalcy ASAP.

As for the initial misstep regarding masking up in public, it's not something I really want to harp about, to attribute blame or whatever. It is however, something worth analysing, whether it's about government decision making, to the public relying too much on the Govt and hence not go beyond the prescribed recommendations (arguably though, in the initial phase, it was actual active discouragement from wearing masks. Though it was changed later, could the initial strong discouragement have contributed to low mask wearing even when the discouragement advice was dropped?), to the public following the letter but not the spirit of the law etc.",2020-04-09 06:30:08,reddit

There is already a shortage of surgical and n95 masks, it's a global issue. That's why they're resorting to giving out reusable cotton masks for regular people even if they're not as effective. 

We don't know how long this pandemic is going to last and we don't know how large is the stockpile of masks. Food isn't really a concern, PPE for healthcare workers is seeing as how many of the big countries are under equipped.

For Singapore, our govt is afraid to anger the CCP, so we didn't ban Chinese arrivals until another country started it, or WHO announced something (cannot remember exactly). It's not too bad as the damage done by Chinese visitors was limited.

"Sometimes a thought experiment can yield scientifically accurate conclusions. Wearing a surgical or N95 to protect YOURSELF is given below.

Q: Does wearing a mask cause you to be exposed to MORE virus than not wearing? (ie virus created out of nothingness or able to replicate without a host)

A: No.

Q: Does the probability (p) that an outside droplet containing COVID19 reaches the protected nose/mouth of the mask wearer go down?

A: YES! It's illogical to even suggest p(no mask) <= p(mask) when a other distance & handwashing regimens are done. Arguments surrounding touching outside mask, improper use, you still need to social distance, or in the case of surgical mask: (droplet can go under mask), are all logical fallacies! Learn how to quickly identify fallacious arguments since this one is the 'Strawman argument'! Answering an argument NOT presented.

NEVER accept a statement about anything from someone using a clear strawman argument.

I claim: Never let perfection be the enemy of the good. As such, the statements above are a dishonest way to argue this scenario. No claim is EVER made by ANYONE that N95 or surgical will bring p=0!!!

This thought experiment is NOT proof. But ponder if you really believe p=0 for mask wearers inhaling the virus.

For those that do  think p=0, I doubt very much we can ever communicate.

Singapore: 5.00% (30), masks worn by some despite lack of recommendation

Italy: 53.2% (30) (at least 20% even excluding the outliers that are greater than 100%), masks presumably not recommended

France: 26.6% (14, same reason as Taiwan), masks not recommended

Canada: 23.2% (14, same reason), masks not recommended

Allowing exception on mask wearing for people who exercise is definitely adding more weight to the problem!!,2020-04-21 12:52:44+00:00,instagram
Just wear mask and keep safe distance when out of house! No exceptions!,2020-04-21 12:55:31+00:00,instagram
Enough time spent on thanking and congratulating people. Focus attention and efforts on action!! Do your job properly and ensure people are wearing masks ALL the time!!

Blessed day to you and family. Stay safe and healthy. I am most concerned with the rise in the numbers of Covid-19 here particularly in the dormitories. People going about out the streets are not all wearing masks. Can the government make it a must for everyone to don a mask when going out?,2020-04-11 04:44:45+00:00,instagram
"Feedback to the Ministerial Taskforce : Remember this. Wuhan started with a few. Then a few hundred. Then a few thousand. Then tens of thousands. And a few hundred / a few thousands infected China nationals then went all over the world. And now ? More than 1.2 mil infected. UK, Italy, Spain, France, USA the same stories. It all started with a few, then a few hundred. And then ? Exploded. Out of Control. Like Italy. Like Spain and etc. Singapore started with a few. Now ? More than a thousand. There were ""many overlook"" Singapore Govt made. One of them : letting in tens of thousands of Malaysians before Malaysia borders lockdown. My feel is? Singapore Govt tried to balance $ making (aka economy) with virus crisis management. So a bit here . A bit there. Some good measures here. Some loopholes there. In the end ? We get to ""nowhere"". Is our economy intact by ""this balancing act"" ? No. Because is serious now, we have this ""circuit breaker"" (much like a lockdown). Our economy went from bad (in Jan) to worse (in Apr) . My frank assessment is this : what ""saved"" Singapore from ""explosion phase"" is : our very good healthcare systems. BUT bear in mind, once the community spread get out of control, from a thousand can easily shoot up to tens of thousands. Touchwood. Should that happen, not even Singapore World Class healthcare systems can save Singapore residents. Singapore would be like Italy. Spain. USA. I am sad, worried, very disappointed. Yes we have good Govt. But I feel our Govt was ""too complacent"". Initially our Govt countered it like SARS. Flashback (CNA 1 Feb) : Dr Brenda Ang : “We have a few SARS veterans here. One of the things I said at the first briefings (for the Wuhan coronavirus) was don’t worry, we have been through this before. We can handle it.”“I saw Singapore's first SARS case, I’m still alive and standing,” she said. On how widespread the Wuhan coronavirus is likely to be, Dr Ang said current literature suggests that even people who are exposed to the virus do not necessarily get infected.“It probably isn’t that infectious, (even though) people are wearing surgical masks all over the place.” (UNQUOTE). @leehsienloong@gankimyong@ongyekung",2020-04-06 18:33:31+00:00,instagram

"FEEDBACK/SHARING OF WORLD NEWS : latest news (CNN) : (QUOTE) Austria ""The wearing of face masks in supermarkets will become compulsory from Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz announced.''As of the moment these masks are handed out in front of the supermarkets and it will become compulsory to wear them in supermarkets'', Kurz said, adding that ''the goal is in the medium term to not only wear these masks in supermarkets but also more generally wherever people have contact with each other'' "" . (UNQUOTE) It is our Govt's job to do it (ensuring enough masks for the people to wear in public e.g. in crowded mrts and buses). Whether is it buying from China or setting up a factory to produce masks, just do it. Wearing masks definitely is effective in the overall containment efforts. You cannot have 1 good measure in say foodcourts distancing control and then ""overlook or fail"" in another area : e.g. mrt , buses. If so, the overall containment efforts will not be as effective. @leehsienloong@lawrencewongst@khawboonwan @gankimyong @ongyekung @teocheehean So in my opinion, our Govt have done a good job in many areas but ""overlook, fail or loophole"" in other areas. This is not good enough for the overall containment effectiveness.",2020-03-30 12:08:51+00:00,instagram

"Dear Minister Wong, I’m very glad to know that returnees from the UK and USA will have to serve SHN at designated hotels starting on Thursday (although it’d have been better to apply to everyone). Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then? Thank you and the team once again for the hard work. We appreciate it and to the frontliners who are doing such a incredible job , it’s going to be a much tougher fight but together we shall overcome.",2020-03-24 13:00:27+00:00,instagram

"I'm guessing the Govt is tryna steer clear of the hard approach (forced universal community testing) by playing a waiting game with the virus thru 2 incubation cycles (2 X 14 days) of home confinement to indirectly ""purge"" asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic carriers of existing viral loads in their bodies (impossible to break the invisible chain of transmission so long as they continue to spread) - hopefully we complement this ""circuit breaker"" strategy with enhanced treatments in hospital and enforced mask-wearing in public (and urgent flattening of the FW dorms curve)... or else our $60b is all freaking down the drain",2020-04-10 03:53:27+00:00,instagram

"👏👏👏It’s about time the government step up and be tougher in the control of the outbreak. I just don’t understand why they are using the standard protocol as SARS when they know this disease have a long incubation period and can spread a lot faster as seen in China. They should have acted faster and STRICTER way earlier. And that will also include stopping mass gathering and congregation unless it’s absolutely necessary. Also should be strict in swooping down on people peddling mask at many times the original price. Thousands of boxes have be bought and kept by some unscrupulous business people so that they can sell it later at many times higher. If the government reinforces strict rules on gatherings for the good of the people, I am sure we Singaporeans will support fully.

"@leehsienloong sir, hope you can also educate people how to dispose / discard their used masks. Today itself I have witnessed two PRC putting their used masks on the seats of public food court & west coast park Mcdonald seats !! Just like Used tissues, they should be discarded immediately after use, otherwise germs and virus would spread, don’t you agree? However a lot of people doesn’t seem to have this habit / knowledge, they know how to wear when to wear but don’t know how to throw when to throw. This is worrying because the virus would simply spread to the next person who sat down on the seat, esp if it’s food court / Mcdonald of high customer turnover !",2020-02-09 13:35:37+00:00,instagram
"Guide to surviving Coronavirus: 1) Buy all the masks you can, even those on Carousell going for $1 per mask. Why? Cos need to make sure you never kena, other people infected but no mask then end up spreading to others is not your problem, everyone else can die except you. 2) Stockpile everything at home. Toilet paper and maggi mee are essentials. Never eat maggi mee will die. No toilet paper don't know how to wash butt will die. 3) Don't travel overseas. Actually don't travel anywhere. Just stay at home 24/7. Maybe you want to close window also so virus cannot enter. When order online must wear hazmat suit to collect delivery then do full decon outside house first. 4) Cut off all ties from all China people. Might as well cut off all ties from your Chinese heritage as well. 5) When new rumour comes out, must share on every chat group you have. Make sure the people you send to also forward the rumour. Make chain messages great again! Sounds pretty ridiculous right? But that's exactly what is happening now. Seriously ppl wake up your bloody idea lah, can use brain and think whether what you doing is logical anot? Instead of flexing your cash and going on irrational stockpiling, how about flexing that brain to think on a wider level?",2020-02-09 02:24:39+00:00,instagram

"I have to wear a mask in normal times - especially during the first and fifteenth of the lunar months ... cos of all the burnings ... sigh ... I have allergic rhinitis. And as a teacher, I have students with very very POOR hygiene etiquette (I have reminded them ENDLESS TIMES but they either forget or can’t be bothered or are too young) - these kids would COUGH, SNEEZE OR BOOGER (as in they take out their boogers and put under my nose or pull out strings of mucus) ... As I am a teacher at an enrichment centre, parents are quite kiasu - as in, they will still try to ‘slip in’ their kid into the class, EVEN THOUGH the kid is coughing or sneezing or not feeling very well!! Nowadays, we are quite stringent - as in, if any kid is coughing / sneezing / boogering - they NEED TO GO HOME!! So, there are parents who just withdraw their kids from our centre and accuse us of being too paranoid. My point is, it depends on your OCCUPATION- if you’re meeting LOTS of people all the time (or TEACHING kids with NO PROPER HYGIENE) - you SHOULD wear a mask.",2020-02-09 01:40:26+00:00,instagram

Which of course increases the risk of the rich themselves also getting the virus, the poor people who are angry at the rich intentionally finding ways to spread the virus to them out of revenge and an economic depression.

"His relating the issues omits the troubles related to the chronology of events: 22 Jan the severity of the outbreak became known and a few days later, it was reported that three days quarantine was sufficient, but by 26 Jan, it became known that 14 days was recommended. In SG, we had not duly restricted air travel nor insisted on precautionary mask usage. By end February, masks were required and some expected a sort of lock-down - but meanwhile it was much business like usual. By the time the circuit-breaker was announced to be put into effect a fortnight later, there was already six weeks or more for MOM Enforcement unit to ensure the FW dorms and communal living supervisors will have implemented the same strict (if not stricter) norms than what was recommended for Singapore generally. This did not happen. The few cases seemingly from Mustafa then were reported and when testing - and only then - were implemented at the affected dormitories that the situation (of clusters erupting) became known as the data showed it had escalated prior to testing. The eventual handling was excellent but the cost of caring for the 50,000 odd infected, not to mention 'exposed' persons has yet to be revealed. The Opposition should call for an independent Public Inquiry into that matter, not for fault finding, but because it represents what has to be accepted as a real, known risk, as long as we have hundreds of thousands in this type of communal living, not to mention aged homes, student dormitories and the such. The data will help us in the future. But Mrs Teo must cooperate and not conceal critical information however condemning. 🕊💐",2020-09-04 00:03:43+00:00,instagram

Loosen the elastic tension on the ear loop... Holding the 2 connecting points (elastic loop and mask) using your thumb and index finger, stretch the elastic loop a few times. This makes the elastic band lose and won't strap to your ear too tightly. Also for mask in the current market, they are mess produced at normal open air factories and not inside Clean Room Environment..... And not certified to medical standards. So it justify the $2.90 for 50 masks catergory. Usual pricing pre Covid-19 is $8~$10 for medical practices purchase. (Dental or clinic).",2021-09-03 08:25:00,hardwarezone

British national Skea Nigel, 52, was serving a 14-day stay-home notice at the hotel when he left his room without a mask on three occasions on Sep 21 last year. According to court documents, he loitered along the corridor outside his room on the 14th floor twice, for about 10 minutes each time.

The pair met on the 27th floor, with Eyamalai opening the emergency exit door for Nigel, the charge sheet read. They then spent the night together in the room from about 2.30am to 11.40am. Nigel was charged under the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 \x96 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020 and COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020.

"From April to December last year, over 8,600 fines - totalling more than $2.5 million - were meted out to people who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures and who did not wear masks. From April to December last year,  more than 6,900 fines were meted out to individuals who did not follow safe distancing and safe management measures. During this same period, more than 1,700 fines were imposed on those who did not wear masks, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) told The Sunday Times. First-time offenders who breach safe distancing measures are fined $300, and second-time wrongdoers $1,000. Offenders may also face prosecution in court for egregious cases and higher fines if convicted. The figures mean that fines for failing to follow safe distancing and safe management measures amounted to more than $2 million. Fines for not wearing masks totalled more than $510,000. MSE added that gathering in groups larger than the permitted size was one of the most common infringements of the Covid-19 safety measures. Another common offence was intermingling at food and beverage outlets, game courts in Housing Board estates as well as parks and beaches. The MSE said: ""Covid-19 remains a serious threat and we must not become complacent, including during festive periods, when there will be an increase in social interactions."" On Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs a multi-ministry task force on Covid-19, cautioned against easing measures introduced to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Since Jan 26, households can have a maximum of eight unique visitors per day. This additional measure comes on top of those already in place, such as the wearing of masks outside one's home which was mandated from April 14 last year. Under phase three of Singapore's reopening which began on Dec 28, groups of up to eight people can gather socially, up from five previously. MSE urged the public to observe the tightened measures announced by the multi-ministry task force. It said: ""All of us must comply with these measures to avoid a resurgence in community cases, which could have devastating impacts on lives and livelihoods. ""Agencies will continue to step up enforcement inspections on F&B premises, malls, parks and beaches, where needed."" In response to queries from The Sunday Times, the police said it supports other agencies to enforce safe management measures at known hot spots. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) conducts inspections of workplaces to ensure that companies abide by safe management measures. Close to 140 firms were told to cease on-site operations after serious violations of workplace safe management measures, which were introduced in March last year. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...afety-measures",2021-02-21 17:02:00,hardwarezone

Try using your hands to cusp the sides and nose, it'd be much more unbreathable. Video shows this very clearly.  It does cut the distance travelled and catches the big ballistic droplets so there is reduction, but the plume is still there, and any slight air movement would move this.

She departed Singapore on 30 January on a turnaround flight to the UAE , and returned on 1 February without disembarking from the aircraft at the overseas destination. She developed anosmia on 4 February, but did not seek medical attention. On 7 February, she was tested for COVID-19 as part of the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore\x92s requirement for air crew to be tested following their return from overseas. Her pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 8 February, and she was conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases for an individual swab, and isolated. Her test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day. Her previous test on 22 January following another turnaround flight was negative for COVID-19. Her serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. She has also tested preliminarily positive for the B117 strain, and is pending further confirmatory tests.* Case 60102 received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 2 February. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, she could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination.* Besides Case 60102, 4 passengers on the same flight (Cases 59885, 59893, 59901 and 59902) have tested positive for COVID-19 infection, and are also preliminarily positive for the B117 strain. In view of her recent travel history, and the possibility that she might have been infected onboard the flight, we have preliminarily classified this case as imported.* https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...feb2021-update Didn't they wear masks on board?",2021-12-02 18:22:00,hardwarezone

"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released new guidance about the best ways to use masks to help prevent transmission of covid-19. One key recommendation highlights the added benefits of using a more snugly fitting mask or pairing a cloth mask with a surgical mask. Experimental data collected by the agency suggests that either option should greatly reduce the risk of transmission between people. Rochelle Walensky, the newly appointed CDC director, discussed the new recommendations during a White House coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. Walensky first reiterated the current consensus that properly worn masks can help limit the spread of the coronavirus. Some masks are better at protecting the wearer from infection (N95 and KN95 masks in particular), but they all limit the outward transmission of potentially infectious droplets and aerosols to others. New research from the CDC, however, looked at the relative effectiveness of different methods using cloth and surgical masks and how it could be improved. In the study, even cloth masks were more effective than no masks at limiting the spread of aerosol and droplet particles the size of those emitted by people with covid-19. But surgical masks that were more snugly fit or that had a cloth mask worn on top of them were the most effective at protecting the user and others. In an experiment that simulated being exposed to an infectious person breathing nearby, having both parties wear better-fitted or double-layered masks reduced the level of exposure by more than 95 percent, Walensky said, compared to no mask at all. \x93I want to be clear that these new scientific data released today do not change the specific recommendations about who should wear a mask or when they should wear one, but they do provide new information on why wearing a well-fitting mask is so important to protect you and others,\x94 she added. The CDC has now updated its website on improving the effectiveness of masks based on this new data. To make surgical masks better-fitting, for instance, the CDC recommends first knotting the strands of the ear loops and tucking in the outer layer of the mask fabric (there\x92s a helpful guide and visual provided by the CDC if that description isn\x92t clear enough). There are also other products, such as mask fitters and braces or masks with nose bridges, that will make a mask tighter. However it\x92s done, you can tell a mask is snug enough if you can feel warm air come through the front of the mask and the mask moves with every breath you take. As for double-masking, the CDC recommends either wearing a cloth mask with multiple layers or wearing a cloth mask over a surgical mask. However, it doesn\x92t recommend wearing two surgical masks at once, or combining an KN95 mask with any other mask (to be fair, these masks are already very good at protection when worn correctly). In addition to wearing masks in public, people should obviously still practice physical distancing whenever possible, avoid crowded indoor spaces, and wash their hands regularly. https://gizmodo.com/cdc-releases-new...ing-1846242314",2021-11-02 08:02:00,hardwarezone

"Surgical masks, even if worn by both parties in universal masking, not 100% lah.  Not even at 1m.   (I read some cdc data is 70% reduction). Copy n paste from another thread........ Study above posted in detail below..... https://msphere.asm.org/content/5/5/e00637-20#F2 Although the initial particle size exhaled was 5.5\u2009\xb1\u20090.2\u2009\u03bcm in mass median diameter , some of the droplets likely gradually evaporated and changed to aerosols. Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2021-10-02 16:22:00,hardwarezone

Wearing mask is just giving people a false sense of security. Add : If the infected rate is high, the chances of catching the virus in crowded places would be high even if everyone wears mask. The main reason why so many people in Singapore are still crowding around in hawker centers and shopping malls (including Chinatown during CNY) is the infected rate in the population is very low (thanks to the various government measures). The testing, isolation and SHN of travelers coming into Singapore are also greatly reducing the possibility of the virus spreading from outside the country to the community.  So, contrary to the concerns of some people, the number of import cases is actually not a concern at current levels (<50 each day). Based on the number of new community cases each day, the infected rate in the population might be 1 in 2 million each day. When the infected rate is so low, the chances that someone in a crowd of a few hundreds has the virus is extremely low.  Add to this, the chances of an infected person spreads the virus to the surrounding is reduced when he/she wears a mask. This is why we have not seen any explosion of the number of new cases despite so many people crowding in hawker centers, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport everyday. Therefore, as long as the infected rate in the population remains this low, crowds of a few hundreds or even a few thousands is, contrary to some people's thinking, not a major concern.

"Just sharing 1 particular case study (there are others as well), for your info...... Somemore below was not B117 variant.... https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/26/11/20-3299_article Transmission of SARS-CoV 2 During Long-Haul Flight Transmission on flight VN54 was clustered in business class, where seats are already more widely spaced than in economy class, and infection spread much further than the existing 2-row (36) or 2 meters (37) rule recommended for COVID-19 prevention on airplanes and other public transport would have captured. Similar conclusions were reached for SARS-CoV superspreader events on a flight in 2003, in which a high risk for infection was observed for passengers seated farther than 3 rows from the index case (4). This finding also concurs with transmission patterns observed for influenza virus (38) and is generally in line with the mounting evidence that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is a major yet underrecognized transmission route (39,40). Making mask wearing obligatory and making hand hygiene and cough etiquette standard practice while on board and at airports seems an obvious and relatively simple measure (27). Blocking middle seats, currently recommended by the airline industry (7,35), may in theory prevent some in-flight transmission events but seems to be insufficient to prevent superspreading events. We conclude that the risk for on-board transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during long flights is real and has the potential to cause COVID-19 clusters of substantial size, even in business class\u2013like settings with spacious seating arrangements well beyond the established distance used to define close contact on airplanes.",2021-10-02 14:13:00,hardwarezone

Quote: When a mannequin exposed to the virus was equipped with various masks (cotton mask, surgical mask, or N95 mask), the uptake of the virus droplets/aerosols was reduced. A cotton mask led to an approximately 20% to 40% reduction in virus uptake compared to no mask (Fig. 2B). The N95 mask had the highest protective efficacy (approximately 80% to 90% reduction) of the various masks examined; however, infectious virus penetration was measurable even when the N95 mask was completely fitted to the face with adhesive tape (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when a mask was attached to the mannequin that released virus, cotton and surgical masks blocked more than 50% of the virus transmission, whereas the N95 mask showed considerable protective efficacy (Fig. 2C). There was a synergistic effect when both the virus receiver and virus spreader wore masks (cotton masks or surgical masks) to prevent the transmission of infective droplets/aerosols (Fig. 2D and E). However, it remains unknown whether the small amount of virus that was able to pass through the N95 masks would result in illness.",2021-08-02 14:03:00,hardwarezone

It is not too late at this stage for Singapore and we definitely can overcome this as a population. Cheers. In before PAP IBs reply The circumstances did not change. Can easily prove that Singapore public health policy was based on fake news that the PAP Ministers and MOH spread. 1) When evidence has been published, the PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist cannot pretend to be blind and say no evidence was seen. Did MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news when he claimed he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...t-is-over-says Professor Tan Chorh Chuan told The Straits Times: ""Singapore's approach of actively looking for new cases and quarantining close contacts has been effective in ring-fencing clusters of infection so far, and we have not seen evidence of community spread. Here is the definition of community spread from USA CDC. https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html What is community spread? Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. As of Feb 27, MOH reported a total of 96 cases. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...-case-12475870 Based on MOH report on 28 February, there were a total of 32 unlinked cases out of 96 confirmed cases = 33% unlinked cases. 33% of confirmed cases were unlinked according to MOH report on 28 Feb, so on what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim that he did not see any evidence of community spread? https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ion-confirmed/ Unlinked cases 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10 11,12,14,15,16,17,18 22,23,29 32,35,37 43,45,46 64 76,78 83,85,87,89 92 Linked cases 8,9 13,19 20,21,24,25,26,27,28 30,31,33,34,36,38,39 40,41,42,44,47,48,49 50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59 60,61,62,63,65,66,67,68,69 70,71,72,73,74,75,77,79 80,81,82,84,86,88 90,91,93,94,95,96 2) Science is based on peer review. Did MOH spread fake news when they said no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb? Yes or no. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...n-moh-12418446 ""Based on evidence available in China, an expert from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has said that there is currently no evidence that the virus can be transmitted through aerosol,"" said MOH. On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. https://www.theguardian.com/world/20...om-coronavirus Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-persp...ction-covid-19 Droplet or aerosol infection spread? Surgical mask or respirator? Asymptomatic transmission or symptomatic only? These are the defining questions surrounding the person-to-person transmission of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 that have yet to be answered\x97or answered sufficiently\x97for US experts monitoring the disease. And the answers hold the key to infection control policies that will become necessary as the disease continues to infect tens of thousands in China and hundreds more across the globe. Yesterday the media reported that a Japanese doctor who was monitoring cruise ship passengers quarantined aboard the Diamond Princess in the port of Yokohama contracted the virus despite wearing gloves and a surgical mask. He joins the more than 500 healthcare workers in Wuhan, China, who have also reportedly contracted the disease\x97just by the middle of January. These infections put into question how effective infection control policies are at preventing transmission. Masks vs respirators\x97key differences In its newly published infection prevention and control recommendations for COVID-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of N95 respirators in a healthcare setting with the suspected novel coronavirus, but the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended surgical masks for general patient care and respirators for aerosol-generating procedures only. Face masks have become ubiquitous in China, sold on the street, and worn by almost everyone in public. A new survey, the Premise Coronavirus Awareness Survey, showed that in Taiwan 79.9% of people questioned said they were wearing masks in an effort to protect themselves from COVID-19. A similar percentage was noted in the Philippines. Bruce Ribner, MD, medical director of the Serious Communicable Diseases Unit at Emory University Hospital, said the two masks serve very different functions. A surgical mask, or procedural mask, is meant to protect the environment from the wearer. ""It's meant to keep the surgeon's respiratory issues away from a patient,"" Ribner explained. A surgical mask does a good job of trapping large droplets, and some aerosol transmission, he said. Many of the masks being worn in China, though, are not designed for medical use or to any standards and so their effectiveness in trapping droplets is unknown. A respirator, such as an N95, fits tighter to the face and is meant to help protect the wearer from inhaling infectious droplets in the environment. ""We don't really know how the coronavirus is being transmitted from person to person, because no one has done the NIOSH studies that simulate the cough big droplets that land 3 to 6 feet away from a person or the little droplets that can travel long distances and in air handling system,"" Ribner said. ""So we have to use what we know about other coronaviruses and influenza when it comes to this disease."" What we know, Ribner said, is that multiple modes of transmission are likely at play, including large droplets, small droplets (or aerosols), and contaminated hands. At Emory, Ribner is responsible for the care of patients treated for Ebola, Lassa fever, and other serious pathogen diseases. Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, which publishes CIDRAP News, says, ""The very unsettling data regarding the number of infected healthcare workers in the Wuhan area and the infection of a Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator\x97should be a real wake-up call to all of us about how do we really protect against this critical occupational risk."" How the virus travels in the air Donald Milton, MD, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland, helped prove via the use of his Gesundheit machine that influenza could be spread via aerosol transmission. He said he is in contact with colleagues in Singapore who are attempting to study the transmission of the COVID-19 viruses, which are often called nCoV, for novel coronavirus. Though Chinese officials said earlier this week that they believe the coronavirus is transmitted only via droplets, implying they do not believe airborne or contact transmission plays a role, Milton said that statement is likely rooted in fear, not science. ""To me this sounds like someone trying to deal with panic, because people panic when they hear airborne transmission and long-distance transmission,"" he said. He said there has been scientific evidence of aerosol transmission of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus), so it is likely possible for this novel coronavirus, as well. Milton cautions that the difference between aerosol and droplet transmission is largely in name only. Respiratory droplets, emitted with a sneeze or a cough, are commonly thought to land within 6 feet of patients and are too large to be buoyant on air currents. Respiratory aerosols are droplets too, Milton said, but smaller and light enough to travel farther. ""You cannot tell the difference epidemiologically between something aerosol transmitted by weak sources and large droplet spray,"" said Milton. ""They behave so similar, it's very hard to pick up the difference."" He said he suspects the capability of long-distance transmission with COVID-19 will be connected to source strength, or how symptomatic a person is. Protection may depend on resources For Ribner, the issue of correct mask use will linger until the exact route of transmission is documented, and it is established if an asymptomatic person (one having no symptoms) can shed the virus before becoming sick. ""If we have a person who is shedding nCoV in the environment, the best way to stop transmission is to stick a surgical procedure mask on them,"" Ribner said. ""In the best of all worlds, anyone coming into the room with an nCoV patient would wear a respirator."" But if a respirator is not available, because of cost or manufacturing, the next best option is a surgical mask, Ribner said. He said that likely contributes to the WHO's surgical mask recommendation. ""The WHO is sensitive to the fact that not every part of the world has the resources of the US and Western Europe,"" he said. Keeping health workers from becoming patients But Osterholm counters, ""Frankly, the WHO recommendation that surgical masks provide adequate protection for healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is not consistent with data we have from similar transmission dynamics we see with influenza virus."" In an op-ed today in the Washington Post, Osterholm and coauthor Mark Olshaker stressed, ""In a very real sense, what happens to our health-care workers will be the metric of how we respond to this unfolding crisis. If we don't do all we can to protect them, they will quickly transition from providers to patients, further stressing already overburdened facilities."" They add, ""Governments must support private-sector manufacturers in providing N95s and other equipment to front-line health-care providers and other essential workers. In terms of minimizing illness and death, this will be more important than any border closing, airport screening, or quarantine.""",2021-07-02 20:51:00,hardwarezone

What was not right is that our leaders shouldn\x92t have followed those advice when it is clear by early February asymptomatic persons could also be spreading the virus. They could have got this info from the China CDC easily, which they probably did but doubted the integrity of the info, which I do not understand why until today. In such cases, it would have been better to be safe than sorry. Maybe they were complacent and thought they could contain this pandemic easily with or without masks. Nevertheless, it is admirable that they are finally doing the right thing despite loss of face. Let\x92s not harp on it anymore and move on.

Oeeeiiii Fox1 and all your Ai Bee clones!!!!! You all phailed Primary Three English de ahh!!! Quote: WHO Interim guidance 29 January 2020 General Advice Wearing a medical mask is one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including 2019-nCoV, in affected areas. However, the use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide the adequate level of protection and other equally relevant measures should be adopted. If masks are to be used, this measure must be combined with hand hygiene and other IPC measures to prevent the human-tohuman transmission of 2019-nCov. sunsetbay wrote: Haha~ I already know they were not telling the truth cos WHO was pretty complacence on the Corona virus as there was mere few cases in Europe & US back then~ Also when LW said they heard from the experts advice, he didn't quote it was from WHO, he also didn't explain who are this ""experts"" were~ then in Feb the four local doctors came out their own health 2M advisory, wear mask & stop mingling~ MOH chief was quick to rebut them, he didn't quote WHO as well~ when CCS audio leak came out, he said he took a gamble to give out 4 masks to make sinkies shiok shiok~ if it was WHO advise, then there wasn't a need to give fake advise~ Worst thing is people like Calvin Cheng and his readers are defending hard for the ministers u-turn advisory~ unbelievable~",2021-07-02 20:51:00,hardwarezone

"It was pretty obvious the 'Healthy don't need masks' message being repeated over and over again was simply due to the critically short supply of masks locally. Saw the news earlier, when Wuhan was in the midst of the outbreak, a Wuhan girl in Sg managed to get NGO's to help her send thousands of mask to Wuhan (I don't blame her, she did what she'd felt necessary), that was a good publicity stunt by those involved, but it certainly didn't help us one bit, did it?. what galls me is that no effort was put by the govt to prevent export of face masks, nor was any attempt made to ration number of masks each person could get for a given period.

It was not until imported cases and FW dorms (much, much later) that caseload started to go up sharply. What does this tell you? 1. Mask was not key driver of caseload. 2. Current mask policy is about minimising risk of spread, but does not change the facts and numbers above. If you don't agree, explain the findings above in a different way. Because facts cannot change What happened with the caseloads back then is cast in stone. Because symptoms are mild for majority and no aggressive testing and 5 days MC nia no need to test... Till today still need to sexplain....",2021-07-02 20:51:00,hardwarezone

In a closed door meeting with SCCI members, PAP Minister Chan Chun Sing said that supply of masks is not enough if everyone rush to buy. The public only knew about this because someone recorded the meeting and leaked it online, which spread viral before finally picked up by MSM and reported as news. 2) MOH Chief Scientist spread fake news that he saw no evidence of community spread on 27 Feb. Why is Singapore public health policy based on fake news? In MOH report on 28 Feb, 32 out of 96 cases were unlinked. That meant 33% of cases were unlinked. On what basis did MOH Chief Scientist claim he saw no evidence of community spread? 3) MOH spread fake news no evidence of aerosol transmission on 10 Feb. Why is Singapore health policy based on fake news? On what basis did MOH claim there was no evidence, just by citing only 1 single publication from China? [Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention ] Did MOH suspect that China publication was fake news propaganda? Remember Dr. Li Wenliang already whistleblew how China tried to coverup the Wuhan virus spread in Dec 2019. He was arrested for fake news. He died on Feb 6 2020 due to the virus. Did MOH review the confirmed case of the Japanese doctor working with those quarantined on the cruise ship [Diamond Princess] and who used standard PPE [personal protective equipment]\x97except for a surgical mask instead of an N95 respirator? Did MOH not review the possibility that if MERS-CoV can be spread by aerosol transmission, why did they rule out Covid-19 being spread by droplets as well? 4) The fact is Singapore public health policy is based on fake news spread by PAP Ministers and MOH Chief Scientist.

So, I think it can be reused after washing, as the mask like any other home made cloth can stop our saliva from firing at people. Washing is also good, and in fact necessary, because soap and water will KILL the virus, so before reusing it, we want to slaughter all the viruses which might have attached themselves happily to the external surface of the mask.

The fact is every country was facing exactly the same crisis and getting the same information and updates since the Covid 19 outbreak was made known on 31 Dec 2020 but other countirs can handle better than our MTF. On the shortage of masks, Singapore is not the only country facing this problem, the rest if not all are also not having enough mask for their people. just take example of Hong Kong and Taiwan. Taiwan's and Hong Kong's Government did not discourage their people to wear mask even there wasn't enough to go along. They (the Authorities and the people) started to improvise - homemade mask after many could not get the mask. Many videos on youtube showing long long long queue in Hong Kong but they soldiered on. As it is better to at least having a mask than no mask be it not as effective as a surgical mask. THIS IS THE POINT WHERE WE FAILED MISERABLY. Our MTF have given many wrong messages to the public. 1. No need to wear mask if you are not sick. They should not have said this. They should in fact just leave it to the public to make their own judgement. Also because of this message, those who worn mask at that time were discriminated.  I remember reading an article about a pre-school kid being penalised for wearing mask to kindergarten and the parent was called to bring him home if he insisted to wear the mask. 2. Covid 19 (Wuhan Virus at that time) Not as deadly As SARs 3. Encourage people to go stayacation and visit places of interest in Singapore. Allow Chingay Parade and Airshow to go on.

Medical teams were sent to Wuhan just before China's biggest festival. They couldn't even wait 1 day. Gatherings were banned and mask was mandatory even outside Wuhan. We are more kiasu or more garang than the bat eaters? Quote: Dr Tan talks so much. Where is he and all the others who talk a lot going to cough up the masks? Talk is cheap hor. The 4 unsung heroes already said use reusable and diy. Reusable mask were not out of stock back then.

I saw few said in the past maybe we don't have enough hotels. We have more than enough hotels... They even used Siloso Beach resort for healthy FWs.. (which covid-19 patients need it more than healthy ones). SG is technically doing semi-home quarantine for undetected cases through CB already. Those who doesn't need clinical care anymore but still positive, home or hotel quarantine is better, safer for both patients and healthcare workers than those community facilities. like to ownself masturbate to make ownself feel shiok shiok so that it's kkj can be long long & stiff stiff. When people kbkp...will use the long long stiff kkj to poke at people as weapons.
