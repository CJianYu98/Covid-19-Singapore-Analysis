"They're already going to allow external people to enter the country without a SHN/QO. People will start to cry father/mother if they didn't extend a similar practice to returning residents.

I'd reckon the requirements might be something similar to that of non-Singaporeans entering the country; a controlled itinerary for the first 14d when they're back in the country.

"> # Returning 'fast lane' travellers can appeal for swab test in place of stay-home notice: Chan Chun Sing

> SINGAPORE: ""Fast lane"" travellers returning to Singapore may appeal for swab tests in place of the mandated 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) they would have to serve when they are back in the country, said Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing on Monday (Jun 15).

> 

> A ""fast lane"" arrangement was set up by Singapore and China to facilitate essential travel between the two countries for business and official purposes.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""While many have welcomed the establishment of the Singapore-China fast lane arrangements, some have asked if it is possible to have alternate arrangements to the 14-day SHN,"" said Mr Chan in a Facebook post.

> ""On a case-by-case basis, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) is prepared to consider appeals for swab test arrangements in place of the 14-day SHN for returning fast lane users.""

> Appeals can be made via email to MTI, he added.

> CNA has reached out to MTI to ask about the criteria under which such exceptions may be made.

> The ""fast lane"" arrangement was launched on Jun 8, and involves Singapore and six Chinese provinces or municipalities: Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang.

> 

> Approved travellers must take a COVID-19 swab test within 48 hours before departure as well as upon arrival, after which they need not be quarantined, but must remain isolated for one to two days while waiting for COVID-19 test results.

> 

> Travellers must also stick to a controlled itinerary that is supervised by the host company or government agency for the first 14 days.

> 

> Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning to Singapore from China will be issued with a 14-day stay-home notice.

> 

> On Monday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that all travellers entering Singapore from Thursday will be tested for COVID-19 before the end of their stay-home notice.

> The ministry also said that travellers from 10 countries or territories, who stayed in the said place for the 14 days prior to their entry, will be allowed to serve their stay-home notice at home instead of a designated facility.

> ""In line with the progressive re-opening of our economy and society, the MTF (COVID-19 multi-ministry task force) has also reviewed the border measures we had put in place earlier to manage the risks of importation and will progressively implement changes as part of our resumption of international travel,"" said Mr Chan.

> 

> Earlier this month, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry Chee Hong Tat said in Parliament that travel will be restarted on a limited scale, focusing first on “essential travel for businesses to function and for purposes such as maintaining critical infrastructure and providing needed services”.

"So here's my opinion: tourist/visitors to get swabbed at their own country, quarantine until results are out, take plane, land in SG, swab at airport and quarantine at airport until the results are out. 14 days shn is too disruptive.

No kitchen, only a kettle and coffee/tea. 3 meals per day are included but they're pretty bland, I've been doing mostly delivery through Foodpanda.

> SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) will put in place more stringent border measures to manage the risk of imported COVID-19 cases, including on-arrival testing for travellers.

> From 11.59pm on Jan 24, all travellers, including Singaporeans and permanent residents, will need to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test upon arrival in Singapore, said MOH in a media release on Saturday (Jan 16).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Existing stay-home notice requirements, including a PCR test at the end of the stay-home notice period, will continue, said the ministry.

> 

> To facilitate the testing process, travellers are ""strongly encouraged"" to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test before departing for Singapore, said MOH.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Currently, travellers who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents who have a recent travel history to high-risk countries or regions are required to take a PCR test within 72 hours before departure. They are then tested at the end of their stay-home notice period.

> MOH said that the new measures will be implemented given the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the worsening coronavirus situation around the world.

> 

> FURTHER PRECAUTIONS FOR TRAVELLERS FROM UK AND SOUTH AFRICA

> From 11.59pm on Jan 18, all Singaporeans and permanent residents returning from the UK and South Africa will be subject to an additional seven-day self-isolation at their place of residence, following their 14-day stay-home notice period at dedicated facilities.

> Advertisement

> They will be tested at the end of their stay-home notice, as with the current requirement, and again after they have completed their seven-day self-isolation period, said MOH.

> These further precautions will apply to travellers who are currently serving their stay-home notice, and they will be in place until further notice.

> Singapore authorities had earlier restricted entry and transit for all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with a recent travel history to the UK and South Africa, due to concerns of a more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus circulating in those countries.

> INSURANCE COVERAGE

> With effect from 11.59pm on Jan 31, visitors applying to enter Singapore under the Air Travel Pass (ATP) and Reciprocal Green Lanes (RGLs) will need to have travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore, with a minimum coverage of S$30,000.

> ""The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers,"" said MOH.

> Currently, short-term visitors entering Singapore under the ATP and RGLs are required to bear the full costs of medical treatment, should they be suspected of being infected with the coronavirus or require medical treatment for COVID-19 while in Singapore.

> 

> ""As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community,"" said MOH.

> ""The Ministry of Health will also continue to review the data and evidence on any new viral strains and update the measures accordingly.""

> Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.

> Travellers are advised to visit the website to check for the most updated border measures before entering Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry, including payment for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities, tests and treatment.

"> # Coronavirus: Man who allegedly breached stay-home notice for bak kut teh likely to be charged

> SINGAPORE - The man who allegedly breached his stay-home notice (SHN) conditions to have bak kut teh will likely be charged.

> Responding queries from The Straits Times (ST), the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority said it has, together with the Ministry of Health, consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC) on the matter. The AGC has indicated that it is likely to charge the man.

> Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam had highlighted a Facebook post by the man, Mr Alan Tham, 33. He had posted on social media photos of his bak kut teh meal while he was supposed to be at home serving his 14-day notice.

> Mr Shanmugam said he had asked for the case to be investigated, and added that stern action will be taken against those who breach such notices, which are issued to all travellers returning from abroad since March 20.

> Those issued SHN must remain in their residences at all times from the day they return, and are not allowed visitors. They are not allowed to go out, even if it is to purchase daily necessities.

> Mr Tham had said he thought the 14-day notice started the day after he returned from a three-day holiday to Myanmar.

> Others who have got into trouble for allegedly flouting the stay-home notice include film producer Mike Wiluan, a permanent resident.

> Upon his return to Singapore from the United States on March 20, Mr Wiluan did not declare a recent trip to Indonesia, which would have subjected him to the stay-home notice.

> The authorities subsequently found out that he had flown to Singapore from Jakarta on March 7, a day before his flight to Los Angeles. Mr Wiluan was then issued an SHN. The authorities also shortened the validity of his re-entry permit.

> It is not clear if further action will be taken against him.

> Those found guilty of breaching the stay-home notice can be fined up to $10,000 and jailed for up to six months. Pass holders may have their passes revoked or the validity shortened.

Many decent jobs have unions. Also, what do you mean by ""have that much more control over you?"" Like, telling you when to show up to work and what to do when you do so? What a novel concept. 

>Also, don't retail workers and mcdonalds employees and shit deserve decent healthcare

"SINGAPORE: Singaporeans were advised on Wednesday (Mar 18) to defer all travel abroad with immediate effect amid a heightened risk of importation of COVID-19 cases into Singapore, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). 

In a press release, MOH said this supercedes the advisory issued on Sunday to defer all non-essential travel abroad. The expansion of the travel advisory is ""to reduce the risk of Singaporeans being infected with the virus when abroad and spreading it to other Singaporeans when they return"", the ministry added. 

In addition, all Singaporeans, permanent residents, long-term pass holders and short-term visitors entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Friday will be issued a 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

For Singapore residents and long-term pass holders entering from the Hubei province in China, they will serve a 14-day quarantine.

They will have to provide proof of the place where they will serve the SHN, for example, a hotel booking covering the entire period or a place of  residence that they or their family members own. 

People under SHN will have to stay at their place of residence at all times for 14 days after entering Singapore.

As announced previously, short-term visitors with recent travel history to mainland China, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea and Spain are not allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.

""Globally, there has been a sharp increase in cases and widening spread across the world. To date, there are close to 200,000 COVID-19 cases across 159 countries, with more than 7,900 deaths,"" said MOH. 

""Many countries have seen an exponential rise in cases recently, and more than 40,000 new cases have been reported in the past three days. 

""Globally, the number of cases and deaths has surpassed those in China since the beginning of the outbreak. 

""The World Health Organization has urged its member states to take urgent and aggressive measures to stop the transmission of COVID-19.""

The authorities also announced 47 new cases of the coronavirus in Singapore on Wednesday, bringing the total figure to 313.",18/3/20,1.0,reddit

"> # COVID-19: Travellers entering Singapore from Victoria in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong to serve stay-home notice at dedicated facilities

> SINGAPORE: Travellers entering Singapore after 11.59pm on Sunday (Jul 19) with travel history to Victoria in Australia, Japan and Hong Kong within the last 14 days, including transit passengers, will have to serve their stay-home notices at dedicated facilities rather than their own home, announced National Development Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday.

> They will also need to take a COVID-19 test before ending their stay-home notice, in line with current requirements.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Speaking at a multi-ministry taskforce press conference on Friday, Mr Wong noted a global resurgence of COVID-19 cases, even in countries which have successfully controlled the virus before.

> “The cases from overseas coming in through our borders represent another risk for us, even as we clear the dormitory cases and therefore we are monitoring the situation very carefully,” said Mr Wong.

> “Our overall advisory remains for everyone in Singapore not to travel or to avoid all travel - that remains the overall posture for now.”

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Previously, travellers entering Singapore from countries with a controlled number of COVID-19 cases were allowed to serve their 14-day stay-home notice in their place of residence rather than a dedicated facility.

> Mr Wong emphasised that this was “not something new”, as the Government has “repeatedly emphasised our border measures are not static”, adding that the taskforce is “constantly reviewing, updating” border measures based on their assessments of the viral situation around the world.

> “We really need to remain vigilant both at our borders, in terms of the measures we have in place at our borders, as well as within our community to continue to ensure that we control the infection and control the spread of the virus within our community,” he said.

> All travellers who have left Singapore from Mar 27 and travellers who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents will have to pay for their stay at dedicated stay-home notice facilities.

> Responding to a question on the task force's travel advisory for Singaporeans for the rest of the year, Mr Wong said that the Government's position - not to travel out of the country - is ""unlikely to change in the near term"".

> 

> While green lane discussions will continue with countries who have ""appropriate control measures"", Mr Wong said that this will only be applicable to essential business travel.

> He added: ""This will not apply to mass tourism travel. That I think will not happen any time soon.""

> SINGAPORE - A 45-year-old Singapore permanent resident (PR) who breached stay-home notice (SHN) requirements while he was in Singapore from Feb 20 to 23 has lost his PR status.

> He has also been barred from re-entering Singapore, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) said on Wednesday (Feb 26).

> According to the ICA, the man was served with the notice on Feb 20 when he arrived at Changi Airport as he had travel history to mainland China in the past 14 days.

> These notices are issued to Singapore residents, long-term pass holders and foreign workers who have travelled to mainland China in the last 14 days.

> He was briefed on the requirements of the notice but failed to respond to phone calls, and was not at his declared place of residence when ICA officers conducted enforcement checks in the days after his return to Singapore.

> On Feb 23, he was spotted attempting to leave Singapore, and was warned that he had breached the requirements of his notice and could face penalties.

> But he still insisted on leaving.

> As a result, ICA said it has rejected his application for renewal of his Re-entry Permit, which allows a person to retain his or her PR status while outside of Singapore.

> This means that he has lost his PR status.

> ICA said: ""The Government will continue to conduct regular random checks through house visits and phone calls to ensure compliance with the SHN, so that the well-being of the community is not put at risk.""

> It highlighted that those who fail to comply with the notice may face stiff penalties, including prosecution under the Infectious Diseases Act.

The sheer number of cases they have still poses a risk, however successfully they have contained the virus at present. The government is having to reassess the travel ban situation everyday because things are changing rapidly across the globe. Sweden and USA and a few other countries will definitely be on our quarantine list soon if things get much worse, which I predict they will be. Please don’t take it personally as we are just trying our best to protect our citizens, as are the Swiss I’m sure, and there is no “best solution” to handle this outbreak at the moment.",15/3/20,1.0,reddit

If the aim is to stop the number of imported cases, it seems to be sensible to go after people who seem to have contracted it in the US -- which seem to pop up daily now (including today) -- rather than just the countries that supposedly might start exporting cases in the future.

This seems to have multiple aims: stop countries with repeated imported cases here and punish countries they feel aren't doing enough to stop the virus. Seems they're punishing countries, like Vietnam, that aren't guilty of either, and letting off a country, the US, that is guilty of one, and arguably both. It's bizarre.

"You do understand that the bubble with HK is not because HK is such a great destination right? It's so that we can open to/with China. There's much less value in creating a bubble with Thailand or Taiwan.

That's not to say that the bubble with HK should carry on if they can't handle their cases (anyway there's already a provision in the HK bubble agreement that it will be suspended for 2 weeks if the 7-day moving average exceeds 5). My point is merely that Thailand and Taiwan are irrelevant to the bubble discussion. I don't see anything wrong with choosing HK as our 'bubble partner' as you put it. It's just a matter of whether that bubble can go ahead.

"> # All travellers coming into Singapore to be tested before stay-home notice ends

> SINGAPORE: All travellers entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Jun 17 will be tested for COVID-19 before the end of their stay-home notice, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Monday (Jun 15).

> The test will be scheduled a few days before the end of the 14-day stay-home notice period, at an allotted testing facility, MOH said in a press release.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Each person under a stay-home notice will receive information on the scheduled appointment slot and venue via an SMS notification.

> “It is an additional precautionary measure to detect the virus, especially given the risks of asymptomatic cases,” MOH said.

> “We will monitor the results of these tests and may make adjustments to the testing requirements over time.”

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These individuals will have to travel from their place of residence to the designated testing facility, and return back immediately after the test, using their own private vehicle, taxi or a private hire car, and avoid commuting via public transport.​​​​​​​

> 

> SOME ALLOWED TO SERVE SHN AT HOME

> Singaporeans, permanent residents and long-term pass holders entering Singapore from Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Japan, Macao, Mainland China, New Zealand, Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam and who stayed in these countries in the last consecutive 14 days prior to their entry will be allowed to serve their SHN at home under the new norms, MOH said.

> Previously, they had to stay at dedicated facilities.

> All those who can serve their stay-home notice at home must remain in their place of residence at all times, MOH said, adding that their whereabouts will be closely watched, through electronic monitoring as well as physical spot-checks.

> However, travellers entering Singapore from countries not in the list will still need to serve their 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities, regardless whether they are residents or visitors.

> PAY FOR TESTS AND STAY AT SHN FACILITY

> All inbound and outbound travellers who enter or leave Singapore from 11.59pm on Jun 17 will also be required to pay for their COVID-19 tests, and those who are not Singaporeans or PRs entering the country will need to foot their own bill for their stay at dedicated SHN facilities.

> Previously, the Singapore Government paid for the costs of stay at stay-home notice facilities for travellers entering Singapore, except for those who left Singapore from Mar 27 onwards.

> It also bore the costs of the large majority of COVID-19 tests, MOH said.

> ""As we expand (and) reopen for more travel, we want to move to a more sustainable position,"" said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong at a press conference on Monday.

> According to MOH, a COVID-19 test for a person under stay-home notice costs up to S$200, while a 14-day stay at a dedicated facility costs S$2,000.

> APPROVAL TO ENTER SINGAPORE

> All long-term pass holders will still need prior approval before coming back to Singapore.

> MOH said the Government has “gradually increased” the number of entry approvals given to these pass holders, “especially those with deep roots to Singapore or have exigent circumstances”.

> “We expect to be able to facilitate the re-entry of more Long Term Pass holders in the coming weeks,” MOH said.

> “We will also study how to facilitate business travels, in particular for professionals based in Singapore who need to travel frequently as part of their work, with the necessary safeguards,” it added.

It's not ""shameful"" per se, just that it's quite a racket that the pharmaceutical industry convinced all of us to be on. Those ""legal"" psychoactive drugs often have side effects that make doctors prescribe even more drugs with their own side effects and by the end of it, you are on six different medications without which you want to kill yourself. There's a name for it: ""[polypharmacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polypharmacy)"".

>So do you agree that in the case of Fukushima, young adults in their 20s should be braving the radiation instead?

If the pensioners didn't volunteer themselves, we can't ask them. If they volunteered, great. They have done their duties and I think they deserve to rest. Young 20 year olds? You are on duty, so get in the suit and do your job. Likewise, with COVID pandemic: old retirees have done their part for society, now they deserve to be protected. Young people? You are on the line of fire, now take that bullet.

Disagree? Look at my username. Empires eat young men lives for breakfast and pay the butcher's bill for their glory.

Well, according to many people, especially Republicans, conservatives, and libertarians, that's not ""privilege"". It's hard work; perhaps not each individual's hard work only, but a collective hard work of myself and people in my support network who worked hard to build a good home environment for all of us.

Well, if you don't; you can start by blaming the parents, then pick up some Molotov's cocktails and start rioting, demanding for changes. That's the traditional way to resolve these kinds of grievances. To demand for better public housing, social safety nets, National Job Guarantee, etc ... If you don't have the courage for that kind of political violence, then you are at the whims of the people with privileges. Money is not a problem, because [war financing](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g26wwu/what_was_your_experience_during_the_20082009/fnk1s5i?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) showed governments have no problem coming up with the money.

That's a secret to power and politics. People with privileges have quite a bit of political powers when everything is peaceful, and I will admit, from this point of view, I am perhaps a person of privilege. The moment violence starts, those power vanishes and it's the violence that holds real power.

"People 'caught' on Jan 2 would have entered around Dec 22ish as they test around Day 10/11 of SHN.

"> # COVID-19 isn't going to wait for us, stay at home as much as you can: Lawrence Wong

> SINGAPORE — With the number of imported cases of COVID-19 continuing to rise, the risk of locally transmitted cases will also increase, making the threat of a widespread virus outbreak “very real”, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.

> Hence, practising safe distancing and minimising social activities is important in slowing down the spread of the virus, and public venues and roads are already less crowded, he noted during a press conference on Tuesday (24 March).

> However, the adjustments to Singaporeans’ daily lives are taking place too slowly, said Wong, who is also the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce to tackle the coronavirus pandemic.

> “The virus isn’t going to wait for us. It is continuing to spread and circulate in our population, and anytime you can get an outbreak,” he said.

> “It is of great concern that you still hear stories of people gathering together. You still hear anecdotes of people gathering in clubs, in discos, where there are large social gatherings which can easily become super-spreader events, and then another cluster will break out after that.”

> On Tuesday, the taskforce announced a slew of measures to further minimise the spread of the new virus.

> Among other things, all bars and entertainment venues - including night clubs, discos, cinemas, theatres, and karaoke outlets - will be closed at least till end-April. All events will also be cancelled, while gatherings outside of work and school should be limited to 10 attendees or fewer.

> Centre-based tuition and enrichment classes, as well as religious services and congregations will also be suspended.

> Wong said the taskforce hopes Singaporeans will take the measures seriously as they are meant to minimise the risk of local transmission.

> “Our key message to all Singaporeans is stay at home as much as you can. Go out if you need to work, go to school, go out for essential tasks, but otherwise stay at home, reduce your social gatherings and all other activities for the next one month,” he said.

> “It is only by all of us reducing our activity level and the intensity of our contacts – that’s the only way where we can significantly reduce the chance of this virus spreading further in our community. And so this is a collective endeavour and we need Singaporeans to really take this task seriously.”

> As of Tuesday, Singapore confirmed 49 new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 558. 17 remain in the intensive care unit while two have died.

> Meanwhile, there are close to 396,000 COVID-19 cases globally as of Tuesday. More than 17,000 have died from the virus, with the death tolls in China and Italy accounting for more than half of the figure.

> SINGAPORE: From 11.59pm on Sunday, all travellers entering Singapore from Malaysia or Japan will have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice period at dedicated facilities, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Nov 20).

> 

> ""The multi-ministry task force has been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and will be tightening border measures given the resurgence of cases in Malaysia and Japan,"" said the ministry.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The new measures take effect from 11.59pm on Sunday and apply to all travellers who have a travel history in the past 14 days to either of the two countries.

> 

> All travellers, except for Singapore citizens and permanent residents, entering Singapore from 11.59pm on Nov 27 who have a travel history in the past 14 days to Malaysia will be required to take a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours before departure.

> TRAVELLERS FROM MALAYSIA

>

> Advertisement

> The Government announced earlier this year that travellers from Malaysia, excluding Sabah, are allowed to serve a seven-day stay-home notice at their place of residence. Those who travelled to Sabah are required to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities.

> 

> ""Given the sharp increase in cases in Malaysia recently, all travellers entering Singapore from Nov 22, 11.59pm who have a travel history (including transit) in the past 14 days to Malaysia will be required to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated ... facilities,"" said MOH.

> 

> ""This also applies to travellers entering Singapore to work under the Periodic Commuting Arrangement and returning Singapore-based travellers under the Singapore – Malaysia Reciprocal Green Lane.""

> 

> TRAVELLERS FROM JAPAN

> Those arriving in Singapore from Japan from next Monday would also have to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities.

> 

> The Government announced on Oct 27 that travellers from Japan were allowed to opt out of serving their 14-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities if they had found a suitable place of residence.

> ""These travellers will no longer be able to opt out of dedicated stay-home notice facilities and serve their 14-day stay-home notice at their place of residence, even if they have obtained approval to opt out earlier,"" MOH said.

"You do understand that the bubble with HK is not because HK is such a great destination right? It's so that we can open to/with China. There's much less value in creating a bubble with Thailand or Taiwan.

That's not to say that the bubble with HK should carry on if they can't handle their cases (anyway there's already a provision in the HK bubble agreement that it will be suspended for 2 weeks if the 7-day moving average exceeds 5). My point is merely that Thailand and Taiwan are irrelevant to the bubble discussion. I don't see anything wrong with choosing HK as our 'bubble partner' as you put it. It's just a matter of whether that bubble can go ahead.

Similarly we are in talks about a bubble with Germany. Not because Germany has better numbers than any other country, or because Germany is very nice to visit, but because they have emerged as the defacto leader of the EU after the whole Brexit saga.",21/11/20,1.0,reddit

"Dear minister Wong thanks for your hard work. But I must say it isn’t a good idea to have the Singaporean/resident returnees serve their SHN at home. I just saw a CNA clip - reporter was doing interview with a pair of sisters who HAD just returned from the UK at their home :(( This is a prime eg why a quarantine at home won’t work. Some people are just not going to abide by the rules to stay inside their rooms at all times (except to use shower/toilet) the moment they reach home from the airport. Members of the family are inevitably exposed who then go on to infect others in the public. We should follow HK , send returnees to govt facilities. We did that with our Wuhan returnees so why not for this group since Europe now is the new epicenter?",2020-03-20,1.0,instagram
"LOA is not = Stay Home Notice. For those travel returnees on LOA, if they are infected and they go out to the public community, e.g. packed supermakets , packed hawker centres, packed mcdonald's, packed malls, there is a likelihood of an ""Uncontrollable BreakOut"" caused by these travel returnees on LOA who may be infected. If a hawker doing say popiah is being infected by the infected, and if she continues to roll her popiahs with some mild symptoms, and unaware consumers eat them, the chance of infection is there. If that happens, all these contact tracing apps will not be that relevant anymore. If Singapore becomes the next Italy, it will be ""too late"". Singapore will then be in a very disastrous situation. Economy will be 10X maybe 100X worse than the current bad situation. Bear in mind this : Singapore society is closely compact and one of the world's highest density population. Can you afford to close down all mrts and bus servicces like what China did. We must take a pre-emptive approach in anticipation of ""the worst possible scenario"" and instead of ""let's see how then react"" . The latter was what Italy , many European countries did. They waited to see how to react. When the crisis exploded suddenly and situation out of control, then they react. But, it was ""too late"" That is  fire fighting approach, not fire prevention. I worry a lot. For families, friends, fellow Singaporeans. Reason : Indonesia. I guess Indonesia will be the next Italy due to their ""reported behaviour e.g. attend large groupings even when their Govt bans them"" as well as ""their Govt citing high costs this high costs that even for Covid-19 testing for many of their potential patients"". Once Indonesia explodes like Italy, I dont think they can do containment as well as ""exploded Korea"". Singapore being its closest neighbor will be in a very very serious, dangerous and risky situation. Will our Govt take our feedback seriously ? We feedback not to curry favors (unlike many instagrammers), get likes attention and so forth.

"Dear Minister Wong, I’m very glad to know that returnees from the UK and USA will have to serve SHN at designated hotels starting on Thursday (although it’d have been better to apply to everyone). Though it’s late, it’s the right move forward. Everyone should be treated as a suspect case and be tested upon arrival, and not just those who present symptoms at the border (which I believe is the protocol now). Mass testing has proven to be the tipping point for South Korea. We need to nip it in the bud - test, isolate, treat. Time is crucial, we can’t afford to wait for symptoms to show up then have patients present themselves at the hospital. If we can gift the Philippines with 3000 test kits surely we can do it for our fellow returnees? Also, at this point we should make it mandatory to wear mask. Wearing one is essential in the fight -  just look at China, Taiwan, SK, HK. “Wear one only when you’re sick” is not medically correct at this point in time. Experts in China have said people shed virus even before symptoms are present. Only by wearing a mask can we protect ourselves and people around us. I know there’s a shortage of masks in Singapore which makes it unfortunate but we can use cloth recyclable masks or any home made ones. When everyone wears one, it doesn’t matter if one’s quality is better than another. It really has helped those countries in containment. That’s certain. But to tell people that healthy people don’t need to wear one is just plain wrong, pardon me for saying. I’m writing as a concerned Singaporean - we must look at the above countries and learn from them. My next worry is when Malaysia ends her lockdown and thousands of people start to cross the causeway into Singapore... since it’s been proven with our recent imported cases that most don’t show symptoms at the border (meaning temperature can no longer be used as a gauge), how then? Thank you and the team once again for the hard work. We appreciate it and to the frontliners who are doing such a incredible job , it’s going to be a much tougher fight but together we shall overcome.",2020-03-24,1.0,instagram

"I realised there have been some comments abt imported cases and community cases, and I wld like to clarify so doubts abt it. 1st, the dorm cases are workers dat are still serving their QO in their dorms or those under RRT. MOH have alr said dat numbers may continue to be high bef tapering down continuously, but dat doesn't mean dat the community is covid free, or yall start to get Complacent seeing low community numbers and go out more often as if covid is over. Cmon, the war is still very very far frm over. A vaccine may not conclude the end of covid, it may be here for up to 2 yrs, or maybe forever, just like seasonal flu, influenza and dengue. To those who are saying dat if u are vaccinated, u can start to be Complacent, by all means, do it urself. Don't drag ur friends or family to be Complacent with u, thinking dat u are totally immuned with covid. Wat if vaccine is not effective? And u start socialising with ppl dat may still be infected after being vaccinated? Cmon, its not the way to do things. WHO have said, dat covid may be here forever w/o a vaccine, and a vaccine is not a straight end to covid. Who knows swine flu is the nxt pandemic? If u think u can start going out more often like pre covid days and socialise as much as u want, then, the ICU ward for covid is reserved for u soon with a ventilator. Sep hols is cming, I wld not xpect crowds do be forming everywhere and ppl are starting to get Complacent. Just on 9 Aug, there was a hell lot of crowd queueing outside tamp mall to scan the safe entry and enter tamp mall. My question to them: has covid ended? Why is complacency stepping in so quick? Just because it national day, covid has hit taken a break yet. And yes true enuf, it was reported as a covid 19 place  due to major Complacency frm the public, thinking dat weekends and holidays its time to go crowded places. Ffs, u are still to stay home!  3rd, imported cases. Imported cases were given SHN, and were tested bef the end of their 14 day quarrantine to prevent spreading to the wider community.

As part of his pre-employment health screening, he was tested for COVID-19 on 5 January even though he is asymptomatic, and his test came back positive. He was subsequently conveyed to SGH in an ambulance. His serological test result has come back positive, which indicates a likely past infection. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases.

All their serology test came back positive (regardless of community or imported) which indicates a likely past infection but we can see that high CT Value also indicates low viral load which determines it to be a past infection . However that was only tested on the day when they tested positive. Just curious, what were their CT Values if they were detected earlier say after SHN has ended instead of several days/months later on their pre-departure test. And how many days in Singapore till tested positive will they still consider it as import case if they have high CT value. 2-3 months? Half a year?",2/7/21,1.0,hardwarezone
"LionsTurf wrote: A lot of these cases had prior negatives, is their some phase of the virus in which your shedding a higher load of dead fragments but when asymptomatic with the live virus then the viral load is lower? If vaccinated with the dead virus version, you also will kena positive test? No idea, this compilation is meant to see how MOH determines what is community or imported. Earlier they classify those who have been out in the community after their SHN is over as community cases even after their serological test came back positive indicating past infection, but slowly changed them all to import case from 24th Jan onwards which is why we see 50-69 days in SG still considered imported. Oddly they classified the Bangla as community even though he haven't started work and have been in the dorms ever since his SHN ended with the reason that the time he tested positive and travelled is very long (55 days). But again you have today a new case where the PR has been in SG for 69 days and they still classify it as imported (even though he has really been in the community after SHN).",2/7/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"An incoming Singapore Management University (SMU) student from Sri Lanka who was serving his 14-day stay-home notice (SHN) at Hotel Grand Pacific repeatedly breached his quarantine by leaving his room. On multiple occasions last August, Mr Nishad Manilka De Fonseka, 20, unlawfully left his room on the 13th storey of the Victoria Street hotel to visit a female friend who was also serving her SHN on the same floor. He was finally caught on Aug 10 last year when a security officer found his room empty with the door left ajar. In an inquiry into Mr De Fonseka's death on Tuesday (Feb 16), investigation officer Victoria Yee told the court that the youth was found motionless, hanging in his room two days later. Inspector Yee added that it is ""strongly suggested"" that Mr De Fonseka had killed himself and that he had been worried about the implications of his breached SHN. She also told State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam that the student was pronounced dead at the scene and there was no reason to suspect foul play. The court heard that the Sri Lankan arrived in Singapore on Aug 1 last year and was served with an SHN. Closed-circuit television footage taken from the corridor outside his room was played in court on Tuesday. In it, he could be seen leaving his room on Aug 10 last year before visiting his friend next door. The court heard that the pair had watched movies on Netflix together. A security officer went by soon after and saw that Mr De Fonseka's room was empty, with the door left ajar. The man alerted his colleagues and the door was closed. Mr De Fonseka left his friend's room at 11.22pm that evening and found that he could not enter his own room. This was because he had not been given an access card to enter it again. In the video footage, he could be seen pacing up and down the hotel corridor. His friend later alerted the hotel and staff allowed Mr De Fonseka back into his own room. SMU was alerted and its senior assistant director of student conduct, Mr Raymond Singh, sent Mr De Fonseka an e-mail to find out more about the situation. Mr Singh testified on Tuesday and told the court that he had also asked Mr De Fonseka for a written explanation on the matter. On Aug 12 last year, Mr De Fonseka's friend alerted the hotel after she failed to contact him. Mr Dickson Teo, who was the hotel's duty manager at the time, arrived outside Mr De Fonseka's room at around 1pm and found that the ""do not disturb"" light was on. Mr Teo testified that he knocked on the door and rang the bell but received no answer. He alerted his colleagues and when they opened the door, they found Mr De Fonseka motionless. They alerted the authorities and he was later pronounced dead. The state coroner will give her findings at a later date. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ed-himself-for",16/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"Widespread sanctions on Myanmar would cause ordinary people to suffer: Vivian Balakrishnan SINGAPORE: Minister for Foreign Affairs Vivian Balakrishnan urged against the imposition of ""widespread sanctions"" on Myanmar, noting such actions would hurt ordinary people there the most. Speaking in Parliament on Tuesday (Feb 16), Dr Balakrishnan pointed to World Bank estimates that about a quarter of Myanmar's population lives below the poverty line, and that this had been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""And so in all my discussions, my phone calls, I have said that we should not embark on widespread, generalised indiscriminate sanctions, because the people who will suffer most would be the ordinary people in Myanmar,"" he said. Dr Balakrishnan's comments come after the military seized power in Myanmar earlier this month, detaining leaders of the National League for Democracy (NLD) party, which had won the country's election last year. Last week the United States announced it was imposing sanctions on Myanmar's military leaders, calling on them to relinquish power. Dr Balakrishan said Singapore hoped for ""peaceful resolution and national reconciliation"" in Myanmar. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...shnan-14207986",16/2/21,0.0,hardwarezone

His swab done on 6 December during SHN was negative for COVID-19. He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 10 February 2021 in preparation for his return to Indonesia. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, although the Ct value was very high, which is indicative of a low viral load. His serological test result has also come back positive. He reported that before his trip to Singapore, he had interacted with his sibling in Indonesia who was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection in October 2020.

Wearing mask is just giving people a false sense of security. Add : If the infected rate is high, the chances of catching the virus in crowded places would be high even if everyone wears mask. The main reason why so many people in Singapore are still crowding around in hawker centers and shopping malls (including Chinatown during CNY) is the infected rate in the population is very low (thanks to the various government measures). The testing, isolation and SHN of travelers coming into Singapore are also greatly reducing the possibility of the virus spreading from outside the country to the community.  So, contrary to the concerns of some people, the number of import cases is actually not a concern at current levels (<50 each day). Based on the number of new community cases each day, the infected rate in the population might be 1 in 2 million each day. When the infected rate is so low, the chances that someone in a crowd of a few hundreds has the virus is extremely low.  Add to this, the chances of an infected person spreads the virus to the surrounding is reduced when he/she wears a mask. This is why we have not seen any explosion of the number of new cases despite so many people crowding in hawker centers, supermarkets, shopping malls and public transport everyday. Therefore, as long as the infected rate in the population remains this low, crowds of a few hundreds or even a few thousands is, contrary to some people's thinking, not a major concern.

"https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...n-8-feb-update Cases in the community: 2 There are 2 cases in the community today who are currently unlinked. Case 60051 Case 60051 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who works as a bus driver employed by Cobb & Coach Services Pte Ltd. His job includes transporting individuals placed on SHN from Changi Airport to dedicated SHN facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip. He developed a runny nose on 31 January but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected when he was tested on 5 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 6 February, and an individual test was done later that night at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 23 January \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60052 Case 60052 is a 30 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder, and works as an engineer at Station Satcom Pte Ltd. As part of his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment. He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 59208[1], and was placed on quarantine from 13 January to 24 January. His swabs taken during quarantine on 13 January and 21 January were negative for COVID-19. Subsequent tests done as part of RRT \x96 the last being on 29 January \x96 were also negative for COVID-19. He developed fatigue on 4 February, and a fever the next day but did not seek medical attention. On 5 February, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of RRT. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. While his serological test taken on 7 February has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low. Case 60052 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 27 January, which accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination. It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the cases, including their family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the cases could have been infected by them.",2/8/21,1.0,hardwarezone

Upon return, BTP travellers will undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test in lieu of the SHN and are required to be isolated in a single location until they obtain a negative result for their OAT. In addition, travellers are required to use TraceTogether, avoid all forms of public transport within 14 days of return, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents.* 10.* *As an added precautionary measure, travellers on this scheme are now required to undergo COVID-19 PCR Tests on*Day 3, Day 7 and Day 14*of their return. An additional serology test will also be required on Day 3. These enhanced testing requirements serve to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community. Travellers are also to avoid events with more than 8 attendees within 14 days of returning to Singapore. 11.* *As compliance to the border measures in this scheme is crucial to safeguarding public health and helping to curb potential transmission of COVID-19 to the community, BTP holders must comply with the border measures in this scheme or risk having their BTPs revoked. 12.* *We will continue to carefully monitor the global situation and the public health outcomes from this scheme in order to strike a calibrated balance between the safety of the local community and resuming business travel in support of our overall economic recovery.",2/9/21,1.0,hardwarezone

Case 60051 Case 60051 is a 49 year-old male Singaporean who works as a bus driver employed by Cobb & Coach Services Pte Ltd. His job includes transporting individuals placed on SHN from Changi Airport to dedicated SHN facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip. He developed a runny nose on 31 January but did not seek medical attention. He was subsequently detected when he was tested on 5 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 on 6 February, and an individual test was done later that night at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 23 January \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection. Case 60052 Case 60052 is a 30 year-old male Indian national who is a Work Pass holder, and works as an engineer at Station Satcom Pte Ltd. As part of his job, he boards ships to install communications and IT equipment. He had earlier been identified as a close contact of Case 59208[1], and was placed on quarantine from 13 January to 24 January. His swabs taken during quarantine on 13 January and 21 January were negative for COVID-19. Subsequent tests done as part of RRT \x96 the last being on 29 January \x96 were also negative for COVID-19. He developed fatigue on 4 February, and a fever the next day but did not seek medical attention. On 5 February, he was tested for COVID-19 as part of RRT. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to NCID. While his serological test taken on 7 February has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low.

"SOS9112001 wrote: in her case, who will be paying her hotel bills? i won't mind quarantine if someone will be footing my bills. Should be gov. Infected locally means gov take care of everything. Including treatment. If citizen/PR travels out and brings virus back, pay for SHN, tests and when positive, one gets gov subsidy, can claim Medishield, insurance, etc and pays the rest. But clear for 14 days then test +ve is likely considered community case now,  so back to free.",2/7/21,1.0,hardwarezone

This is a 35 year-old female Indian national who is a Long-Term Visit Pass holder. She travelled to India from 30 November 2020 and returned to Singapore on 6 January 2021. Her pre-departure test taken in India on 4 January before her flight was negative for COVID-19. Upon her return, she served SHN at a dedicated facility until 20 January. Her swab done on 17 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19. She is asymptomatic, and was detected when she took a COVID-19 pre-departure test on 2 February in preparation for another trip to India. Her test result came back positive the next day, and she was conveyed to KK Women\x92s and Children\x92s Hospital in an ambulance. We have classified this case as locally transmitted while her serology test result is pending. Should her serology test come back positive, and epidemiological investigations assess that this is a past infection, we will reclassify this as an imported case. In the meantime, all the identified close contacts of the case, including her family members, have been isolated and placed on quarantine, and will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period so that we can detect asymptomatic cases. We will also conduct serological tests for the close contacts to determine if the case could have been infected by them. This case reclassified as imported.",2/7/21,1.0,hardwarezone
"Not applicable to us. We have almost no community transmissions (could have been 0 if not for contact with SHN and other foreign parties), the solution is simple. Close the borders, test everyone who comes in, don't allow entry at all for infected, send them back instead of SHN, done.",2/7/21,0.0,hardwarezone
