"> # Parliament: 5-person limit for gatherings could be removed, but all must cooperate to keep guard up

> SINGAPORE - There can be more easing of pandemic control measures, including the limit of five people for social gatherings, if everyone can work together and keep their guard up, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament on Monday (Oct 5).

> Allowing larger groups to meet would allow bigger families or groups of friends to meet and have meals together, he said in responding to questions from several MPs on the loosening of Covid-19 rules here.

> Singapore has gradually eased some of its pandemic control measures over the past few months, leading some to question when the cap of five people for social activities - especially when eating out together - would be lifted.

> Mr Gan said on Monday: ""We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time. The risk is considerably higher than activities which we can keep our masks on and maintain a safe distance.""

> He pointed out that Singapore has already made big steps towards restoring economic and social activities - in a safe manner.

> For instance, from Sept 28, more employees who have been working from home were allowed to return to their workplaces.

> But in order to keep workplaces safe and minimise crowding, such employees are to continue to work from home for at least half their working time, with no more than 50 per cent of such employees at the workplace at any point in time.

> Work-related events, including conferences, seminars, and meetings, have also been allowed to resume with a 50-person limit to reduce the risk of transmission.

> The authorities have also taken steps to support the resumption of a few very targeted and specific areas, said Mr Gan.

> These include the increase in group size limits for key life events such as weddings and religious activities to 100 persons, but in multiple zones or time slots of at most 50 persons each to limit potential risk exposure.

> The Government had also earlier allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Singapore Zoo and Bird Park.

> Related Story Places of worship slowly open up to more worshippers as Covid-19 rules eased

> Museums and libraries have also reopened, and small-scale live performances are being trialled to prepare Singapore to eventually be able to resume such activities safely, added Mr Gan.

> He added that the authorities here are being careful in reopening society, as they have learnt from the experiences of other countries.

> ""When restrictions are lifted prematurely, or too hastily, a resurgence of cases may occur, resulting in partial reimposition of restrictions. On the other hand, it is not sustainable to maintain tight restrictions for a prolonged period which will severely impact our economy and our lives,"" he said.

> So the Government has taken a carefully calibrated approach in moving towards phase three, and will share more details in the coming weeks.

> Minister for Education Lawrence Wong also said earlier on Monday that his ministry is studying how to resume more activities, and will share more details when ready.

> But Mr Gan cautioned: ""The low number of community cases currently is not accidental but has come about due to our collective hard work and sacrifices. Even as we move towards Phase Three, the new normal will be different from what we were used to in the pre-Covid days.""

> He added: ""As overseas travel restrictions are progressively eased and more activities resume, it has become even more critical that each of us plays our part to exercise social responsibility and adhere to the safe management measures, in order to keep our family and friends safe.""

But there is a loophole now. FnB can then just sit 2 groups of 20 and 25 (or n groups as long the sum of people in the n groups are less than 50) without any regard on the 1m social distance. FnB could still claim that this 2 groups are actually the same group.

> ""I also went to check on how things were at the two FairPrice supermarkets in vicinity (this is part of my job to find out from time to time how operations were and situation is on the ground),"" said Mr Seah, who is also group CEO of NTUC FairPrice.

> ""At same time as I walked through the estate, I would pass by the kopitiams in (the) estate, wet market too. And I thus made those observations. At all times observing safe distancing rules. Based on what I saw, happy that things are all in order,"" he explained.

> ""One or two merchants in wet market had some feedback for me as well. All short conversations. Another two residents who saw me had some enquiries for me which I gave them my advice accordingly. All parties concerned observed the safe distancing rules.""

> As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, authorities have asked residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as to buy food or groceries. Even then, people should go out alone and not in groups. It is compulsory to wear masks once they leave their homes.

> Safe distancing ambassadors have been appointed to remind people of these rules. Those who do not comply will be issued a fine.

> In his Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Seah said he observed that compliance with safe distancing measures was high, and temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet markets.

> SINGAPORE - A safe distancing ambassador was fined $300 for not wearing a mask while he was conducting surveillance checks at a shopping mall, after photos of him failing to wear the mask were shared on social media.

> In response to media queries, Enterprise Singapore (ESG) said on Saturday (April 18) that it had deployed the safe distancing ambassador to conduct surveillance checks at shopping malls.

> Based on its investigations, the man had gone to the restroom during his break and forgot to put his mask on after leaving it, which was when the photos were taken.

> The images of the safe distancing ambassador not wearing his mask were taken at White Sands shopping mall on Wednesday and posted by Facebook user Daniel Wong.

> The man is seen talking to another safe distancing ambassador, who is wearing a mask, and riding on an escalator with him. The Facebook post with the photos, which was uploaded on Thursday, has been shared about 850 times as of early Saturday afternoon.

> ESG said that the man put on his mask immediately after other safe distancing ambassadors reminded him to do so.

> It added that it takes a serious view of such infringements and has issued a stern warning to the man, in addition to the $300 fine.

> ""This is consistent with the penalty imposed on individuals who are found not wearing a mask in public, as we expect our safe distancing ambassadors to uphold the same standards,"" it said, adding that the man has accepted the penalty and apologised for his mistake.

> ESG said it has reminded all safe distancing ambassadors about the requirement to wear masks at all times when they are not at home.

> SINGAPORE: Member of Parliament Seah Kian Peng has explained why he was out and about at his constituency on Sunday (Apr 26), after netizens questioned his Facebook post that said he was ""playing the role of a safe distancing ambassador"".

> 

> The Marine Parade GRC MP raised eyebrows after he said that he spoke to residents at coffee shops and at a wet market.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Netizens questioned if he was keeping to stay-at-home requirements during the ""circuit breaker"" period, and some pointed out that he was without the red armbands and passes worn by safe distancing ambassadors.

> Others noted that the People's Action Party had announced earlier this month that it would suspend ground engagements and face-to-face Meet-The-People sessions.

> In response to CNA queries, Mr Seah said he has been working from home ""almost the entire week"", and that he was out on Sunday as he had to sign some documents at the community club.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""I also went to check on how things were at the two FairPrice supermarkets in vicinity (this is part of my job to find out from time to time how operations were and situation is on the ground),"" said Mr Seah, who is also group CEO of NTUC FairPrice.

> ""At same time as I walked through the estate, I would pass by the kopitiams in (the) estate, wet market too. And I thus made those observations. At all times observing safe distancing rules. Based on what I saw, happy that things are all in order,"" he explained.

> ""One or two merchants in wet market had some feedback for me as well. All short conversations. Another two residents who saw me had some enquiries for me which I gave them my advice accordingly. All parties concerned observed the safe distancing rules.""

> 

> As part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, authorities have asked residents to stay at home except for essential activities such as to buy food or groceries. Even then, people should go out alone and not in groups. It is compulsory to wear masks once they leave their homes.

> Safe distancing ambassadors have been appointed to remind people of these rules. Those who do not comply will be issued a fine.

> In his Facebook post on Sunday, Mr Seah said he observed that compliance with safe distancing measures was high, and temperature screening and crowd control measures were in place at popular places like supermarkets and wet markets.

> ""Take care and stay safe,"" he wrote, adding hashtags like #socialdistancing and #walkabout.

> 

> Responding to online criticism of his post, Mr Seah told CNA on Monday: ""I hope we don’t politicise this matter. It appears that some are clearly wanting to do so.""

> 

> He added: ""If people want to volunteer as a SDA (safe distancing ambassador), it takes a few hours a day and some of them especially during the initial period had it rough. So it is work for them.

> ""Let’s focus on what we all need to do. And work as a team whether you are part of those providing essential services or WFH. If I can make a call out, I hope all of us make things easy for the essential workers and also SDA and let us continue to show our appreciation to all those who are going to work day in, day out to provide these essential services for us.""

> 

> Another MP, Liang Eng Hwa of Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, also posted about being a safe distancing ambassador on Sunday. He was seen wearing a yellow vest like the other ambassadors.

> Mr Liang wrote: ""Joined as one of the Safe Distancing Ambassador (SDA) this evening. With the exception of a few, by and large residents are in compliant of the circuit breaker measures.""

"If you really have no choice and have to carry out the CNY gathering (within legal limits), then you can consider doing things that the govt has been doing for public areas and large events:

(1) Check everyone's temperature before letting them into the house.

(2) Continue to wear mask and sit further apart during the gathering.

(3) Make sure everyone washes their hands before eating.

(4) Serve individual portions and don't share food, and minimise talking during eating.  Also try to seat everyone further apart, if possible.

(5) Continue to keep in touch with everyone who has visited your house and whose house you have visited for two weeks.  At the first sign of someone having flu-like symptoms, quickly inform everyone, and make sure everyone in your household monitor their health carefully.  Importantly, avoid socialising to minimise spread to the larger community, until you are certain that there is minimal risk.

"If the government is not prudent enough in its handling of borders then we will be having waaaaaaayyyy more numbers than what we are having right now. The problem is not a policy issue. The problem is how the policies are translated on the ground - in other words, we need to see if there are lapses that have occurred that allowed the virus to break through our defenses. That is the part that no matter how much government involvement you have, you can never be sure that no breach in protocol won’t occur. 

Ultimately, the government can only lead, but it is the people who enact these policies or procedures that have to ensure it’s all followed. These include the everyday people who need to follow social distancing policies, shn rules, reporting sick guidelines. It’s like driving a car, government tell you what the speed limit is but if you choose to speed and kena accident, whose fault? By all means grab the pitch fork but make sure you point it at the right person. 

Anyway back to this issue. Since a good portion of the numbers of community cases come from those who work at airports, I feel the next wisest decision is to scrutinize the airport’s own policies and protective measures and see if it’s strong enough or if there are gaps that we need to fix.",2021-02-08 11:20:24,reddit

and if youre one of those whose intent is to say to limit all entry to foreigners, i beseech you to consider other factors other than covid numbers alone. entire economies will go bust if we do so. not just tourism but other economies that rely on foreign labour. remember that Covid is here for the long run, not just another year or two. how long you want to keep the seclusion before opening up the borders again?

>Also, it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride people for not ""following guidelines"". All I'm saying is, stop being so quick to bash Singaporeans just because they bend a few rules here and there.

allow me to hit the ball back into your court. it's easy to sit on a high horse and deride the government for not being prudent when you only make considerations upon a small window of factors. 

and also, please hold everyone to the same, equal standards - if the government must be prudent in its decision making, so must the people. can't ""bash singaporeans"" just because they decide to relax a bit? don't ""bash the government"" because they also relax. 

and don't get me wrong, i hold the govt of singapore to the same high standards i hold the people of singapore. if they're shit, i'll be the first to raise my pitchforks. but to say that the people should not shoulder blame for becoming complacent, for not sticking to the same standards we could and did uphold the past year, is the start of a slide down a slippery slope. this growing ""superiority complex of the collective people"" idea needs to be kept in check, otherwise it can lead to our own downfall. recognizing our own problems and shortcomings is a strength, not accepting our own faults is a weakness. and especially in times of a crisis like we are in now, a weakness like this only spells greater trouble for the future.",2021-02-10 01:31:49,reddit

I think it's oversensitive of you to assume that OP is on a high horse and that he is smug because he's ready for cases to spike after CNY. I am also expecting a spike, because people simply will not follow instructions if they're not monitored.

This is the same reason why we need the safe distancing people sitting at the entrance of every location. Because people can't be trusted to do the right thing. See the Chinatown situation, for example. 

Another example: people who will not use the safe entry if the shops themselves don't employ a person to stand at the entrance and force people to do it. I have seen many a person just walk into the shop without scanning. Sure, I try to ask them to do it, but I can't catch every person. It's personal responsibility, which, unfortunately, a lot of Singaporeans lack. This is why we need to be nannied. 

This is why I (and probably OP) have no faith that the capacity limit will be followed during CNY. Or the house visitation limit, for that matter. It simply boils down to a lack of personal responsibility.",2021-02-08 15:29:53,reddit

"So the lashes with the rattan cane are often misunderstood. You get sentenced with 5 lashes, let’s say.  We understand it that they hit you 5 times and you walk out pretty sore. But that’s not how it’s done. 

They hit you once, on bare skin, really hard and send you back to your cell. You heal fairly well with some swelling and maybe a scar or two. Once you e healed, they do it again. Same place. This time as the split came comes back together it gabs hold of scar tissue and rips it off. And back to your cell you go to heal. Longer healing now in a dirty cell. Maybe infection sets in. More damage. But you heal, eventually and they bring you in fir the third set. 

By the fifth set, they’re pulling out muscle tissue and you are hobbling, if able to stand at all. The infection you get in your dirty cell will probably kill you. If not, you’re maimed and crippled for life. 

That’s why there is very little crime in Singapore. 

That’s why that teenager years ago who was caught spray painting walls was so scared for his life. He got like 7 lashes in a sentence and the parents got President bush to help him with a “get out of jail free” card before the sentence was carried out!!!",2021-01-18 14:29:44,reddit

Of these, 58,784 people have fully recovered and have been discharged from hospitals or community care facilities.](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/24-new-covid-19-infections-singapore-including-4-community-cases-and-1-foreign-worker-dorm) So we only have about 300 active cases.

What happens if he gets out, no one notices, and passes the illness to 3 random people in the hotel? And what if they're asymptomatic when they start becoming contagious (which is usually the case), and spread it to wider society?

Who's going to answer for the people who fall ill? Who's going to answer for those who may potentially die? What happens to peoples' livelihoods if we are forced to go back under lockdown?

In that cause they have fought with the Dutch against the Spanish, with the Germans against the French, with the French and Italians against the Germans, and with the French against the Germans and Italians. 

Now in modern times to break the whole EU thing up, they had to get inside. If they tried to break it up from the outside, that wouldn't work. Now that they were inside they could make a complete pig's breakfast of the whole thing — set the Germans against the French, the French against the Italians, the Italians against the Dutch... it's just like old times.

They were originally pushing for an increase in the membership at the start so it would be just like the United Nations, in fact; the more members it has, the more arguments it can stir up, the more futile and impotent it becomes.

And then, BREXIT.

The former commonwealth counties however won't rejoin in a union with the UK because we know where it would lead to and exactly why.  After all, we do have our own parliaments based on Britain's own.

"Commercial clubs are upscale, there aren't many underground clubs. All clubs are alcohol focused cause that's pretty much the only option. And no, the punishment for buying or possessing drugs isn't death, the authorities don't really care about small fry recreational drug users. They target traffickers and dealers and people who possess huge amounts. I have a friend who's about to be released (yay!) after 5 years in prison for possession of a variety (yup, not just one type) of drugs. Whilst awaiting trial, he was sent to rehab. So don't believe the fearmongering from foreign journalists who don't have in depth knowledge of what truly goes on in the country.

 Anyway, I'm pretty sure the police knows which clubs/parties they'll find recreational drug users and if they wanted to arrest anyone at any point, they would've done so. So far, I haven't seen anyone getting arrested in any club. But that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I know people who've been to prison for either possession, consumption, dealing. Depending on the quantity and type of drug they had on them at the time, the sentence is anywhere between 12 months to... well, years. These people are also educated, functional, intelligent people who go on to lead normal lives after release. There's nothing wrong with a little fun now and then, and the war on drugs needs to end.

"I suggest you ignore him. He is known on r/singapore as a master practitioner of r/enlightenedcentrism and authoritarian apologetics, to the extent of making up irrelevant strawmen.

As a Singaporean that identifies as centre-left, I will tell you the country has a regressive, anti-intellectual stand towards drugs, capital punishment and corporal punishment. It is a huge blind spot of an administration that crows about its technocratic, evidence-based policymaking. It is founded on the dubious assumption that extant research and case studies on failed drug wars are fundamentally irrelevant to the Singaporean experience (as an island city-state), and that a drug war can not just be won, but is desirable. And also that harsh punishments are something demanded by the majority of the populace - ignoring that fact that reverence of authority and a retributive streak were socially engineered by the government.

That said, some of this apologism, I think is a symptom of overcorrection. Tired, Orientalist caricatures have not kept up with the social development of Singapore (eg. the whole chewing gum thing), and there is therefore a desire to leap in the country's defense. Hell, they were caricatures even when they first emerged. Flawed, yes, but to have a realistic image of when and where torture and brutality happens.

Progressive activism is also viewed as a neo-colonialist enterprise by the West by too much of the population. The legacy of colonialism is fraught in this region. There is much trauma. To some extent the government has cultivated this trauma to their advantage to malign progressive activism, especially when such activism first gained traction in global culture through discourses in ex-colonial powers in the West.

"I mean sure. If you want to pretend that Singapore executes and canes literally everyone who does something wrong or illegal. 

There is of course a more complex view to take like the fact Singapore has a lot of the basic necessities really nailed. Housing is subsidised for almost every citizen who wants to buy into government housing ( I own one with my wife. It's a flat. It's great and is actually designed to make it possible to own a home. Singaporeans will debate the benefits and cons of HDB due to its 99 year lease system but compared to back home... I don't think id ever have been able to peruse being a designer and still get to own a home in a city that I can find work )

The food is subsidised, local hawker culture is some of the tastiest and cheapest food around. Nothing compares to it in the UK. The idea that you can go out everyday and it's cheaper to eat and sit down with family and friends than to eat at home (unless super frugal) still blows my mind. 

The national insurance equivalent, CPF is usable for more than just your eventual pension. You can use it for medical bills ( on top of already subsidised healthcare. Albeit as someone who suffers from a lot of health issues I do miss the NHS ), you can use it to pay for your home loan and your employer has to match you monthly contribution as well. 

Education is some of the best in the world, the school rankings here leave me feeling stupid as hell when I meet kids who are in 'not as good' schools who are still brighter and more educated than I could ever say I was at that age. Albeit that this comes with the cost of extreme child stress, which is the problem Singapore is now trying to work out how to address. Maybe a bit slower than it should be...

I think Singapore just looked at a lot of the things that make crime common, you know... poverty and access to basic needs. 

I'm a big old SNP voting lefty, so take all this as you will. I just feel like if the UK gov actually wanted to be like Singapore, I hope the low tax bit isn't the thing they take. I hope it's the subsidised housing, the food support etc etc.",2021-01-18 18:55:46,reddit

It also creates a presumption that a person possesses drugs if he possesses the keys to a premises containing the drugs, and that ""Any person found in or escaping from any place or premises which is proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have been smoking or administering a controlled drug in that place or premises."" Thus, one runs the risk of arrest for drug use by simply being in the company of drug users. The law also allows officers to search premises and individuals, without a [search warrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_warrant), if he ""reasonably suspects that there is to be found a controlled drug or article liable to seizure"".

Kind of dishonest to pretend like they don't execute you for possession when they do, they just redefine ""trafficking"" to mean ""possession of a certain amount, whether or not they actually...uh...*possess* the drugs.""

That, combined with the fact that my existence as a gay man is illegal and I can't reasonably hold a demonstration against these injust laws, is why I'm being smug about Singapore's human rights. Because they're actually shit.",2021-01-18 20:34:46,reddit

It's completely fair for people to contribute to this discussion who both agree with and disagree with the authorities response. Your attempts to remove me from this discussion is amusing though.

First thing to note is that you are working under the assumption that these laws save lives. I have shown you evidence that they don't, and they are largely detrimental. Are you willing to even consider the opportunity cost involved? The lockdowns on a global scale are very literally going to result in massive deaths in poorer nations due to starvation, and you don't think that the scale and scope is comparable?

You are working off of the false premise that ""if it only saves one life it is worth it"" but you selectively ignore all of the data that shows this is quote the opposite. And if that is true then shouldn't we ban everything, literally anything can cause harm. Forget about seatbelt laws, let's ban cars all together. My questions are where do you draw the line and what's the appropriate balance. You are allowed to have a different opinion, but the more you defer to government to choose where that line is you better believe they will keep moving that line year after year, and crisis after crisis.

"I started typing up this response about to shoot down your analogy, but it’s actually pretty good. If a significant proportion of the population don’t get vaccinated, we start to see a resurgence in previously controlled diseases, but at their core, vaccines are still essentially selfish - people get them primarily to protect themselves. 

Masks are similar in the sense that they require herd compliance to be effective, but not to the same degree - the protection a mask offers the individual wearing it is pretty minimal. It’s value is in preventing droplets becoming airborne, which is generally more of a benefit to other people (at least for the strips of cloth worn by the average shopper). 

The difference is, the general population aren’t really affected by antivaxxers. The fact that they’ve been vaccinated themselves protects them. It still significantly increases the risk to the vulnerable who can’t have a vaccine, but the vaccinated majority severely limits the ability for it to spread. 

That’s not yet the case with Covid. Antimaskers put everybody else at risk every time they enter an enclosed space without a mask. If they have it, they can easily spread it to 2-3 people in every shop they visit. If one of those are staff, or somebody who works closely with many others, that one trip to Tesco can easily start a wave that infects literally thousands.

As an outbreak grows, the responsibility lies with the authority in charge of that reason. When it's a lab, it's the company, when it expands to that district, it's the district authority, when it becomes the city, the city authority etc. etc. etc.

"> # Safe distancing on public transport 'will not be possible' at times after circuit breaker ends: Khaw

> SINGAPORE — With commuter numbers expected to rise when Singapore’s circuit breaker period ends on Monday (1 June), there “will be times when safe distancing will not be possible” on public transport, said Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan.

> “We have been able to ensure safe distancing so far because commuter numbers have plunged. From tomorrow onwards, it will be more challenging,” he said in a Facebook post on Monday.

> In the post, Khaw shared pictures of himself and a public transport worker removing safe distancing notices from seats on an MRT train and a bus, respectively. In another image, Khaw seen next to a poster at an MRT station for the SafeEntry app, with the minister describing its use as part of “the new normal”.

> “We still urge Singaporeans to work from home and for those who need to leave home, to stagger their time and avoid traditional peak hours,” said Khaw, who stressed the importance of commuters wearing masks “all the time”.

> Khaw also advised commuters to refrain from conversations and observe personal hygiene.

> Noting that many are looking forward to the end of the circuit breaker, which began on 7 April, he added that the easing of measures needed to be done “gradually and carefully”.

> “Unnecessary haste may lead to an uncontrollable spike and cluster. We do not want to have to hit the circuit breaker again,” said Khaw.

> From Tuesday, Phase 1 of Singapore’s re-opening will see businesses in sectors deemed at low risk of COVID-19 transmission being allowed to resume operations. Households will also be allowed to receive two visitors per day, while places of worship will be re-opened for private worship sessions. Primary and secondary school students who are in graduating cohorts will also be returning to school.

Trains would be the one seeing the bottleneck, although that's presuming that 3min frequency is optimum give and take, and we want higher frequency to translate to similar travel time. We can have more trains on hold in between lanes, but that will be on the expense of time to take a more preventive measure.

"> # Covid-19: 40 new cases in S'pore, stricter safe distancing measures including 1m separation; all events with 250 people or more suspended until end-June

> SINGAPORE - Stricter safe distancing measures will be introduced to reduce the risk of further local transmission, the authorities announced, as Singapore reported another 40 Covid-19 cases on Friday (March 20).

> Keeping a safe space around individuals is especially important for vulnerable segments of the population, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said at a press conference.

> All events and gatherings with 250 or more participants are to be suspended until June 30, while the suspension of all social activities for seniors by government agencies will be extended for another two weeks until April 7.

> Events with fewer than 250 people and operators of venues accessible to the public, such as restaurants and cinemas, are also required to implement measures to ensure separation of at least 1m between patrons.

> The measures will apply across the board for all events, including religious and private gatherings.""

> Employers have also been strongly advised to allow their employees to work from home, or implement staggered working hours where telecommuting is not possible.

> Non-critical work events should be deferred and critical ones scaled down to no more than 250 participants at any one time.

> ""When combined with good personal hygiene, safe distancing measures can help to slow the spread of Covid-19"", said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of a multi-ministry task force to fight the coronavirus.

> He added : ""Our healthcare professionals are working hard to take care of patients. We don't want to add to their load, and therefore, it is important to add these measures to ensure our healthcare workers have the capacity to look after our patients.""

> Singapore has witnessed a recent uptick in new cases daily that has been largely due to a sharp increase in imported cases, as Singaporeans studying and working abroad return home from other countries where the number of infections continue to rise.

> Of the 40 cases confirmed on Friday, three-quarters were imported.

> There were only 33 imported cases from Jan 23 to March 9, with this number rising to 156 from March 10 to March 20.

> Imported cases have also nearly caught up with non-imported ones for Singapore's total of 385 cases.

> Stressing that is cannot be business as usual, task force co-chair Lawrence Wong, the Minister for National Development, said that the aim was to have fewer people out and about, and a reduction in social gatherings and any activity that could be a potential social vector for the virus.

> On how the safe distancing measures will be enforced, Mr Wong said this can be done in several ways.

> For example, food and beverage outlets that are licensed will have to close some tables.

> ""So it is not an option, it is not advisory, it is mandatory,"" he said.

> ""We will start tomorrow and it will take some time to roll out fully but we will aim to do so as quickly as possible.""

> He added: ""We do not want to see crowded venues, we do not want to see packed event halls. We should see more work from home, more takeaways.""

> ""We will be enforcing the rules. There will be some inconvenience but we also need all Singaporeans to cooperate. And if we are all very disciplined about this it will give us better control and enable us to control spread of virus.""

> Mr Gan had announced on Wednesday that non-Covid patients could be transferred to private hospitals to free up capacity at public hospitals.

> He also said there are plans to convert normal wards into isolation wards, and quarantine facilities into care centres for Covid-19 patients with less severe symptoms if the number of cases here continue to rise.

Then theres the issue of what a lockdown actually means. Its easy to say ""well, lets just give exceptions for essential services, like healthcare workers, people working in critical industries like water, telecoms etc"". But the devil is in the details: where do you draw the line? Obviously, clubs and pubs aren't essential. But what about hotels where you house the people in SHN: these need to be somewhat staffed as well, right? What about our military --- is that essential? And then you come to hawkers and restaurants: our frontline workers need to eat too, right? Even if you allow only for takeouts, the eateries still have to be open. Or our ports: we've got to ship in food and supplies from *somewhere*.

"This will be hard to enforce. Why don't they just enforce takeaways in those heartland hawker centers and kopitiams?

In shopping malls/ CBD area maybe these can be enforced cos they might not have elsewhere they can sit and eat if they are working, but those going to heartland hawker centers? So near their house they can just dabao tbh.

I think we need to educate those people and actually catch/ fine/ jail some of them to actually make a point to the rest so they won't think it is nothing (which many of the uncles/ aunties are thinking right now).

The gov can come up with new rules/ measures, but if people don't cooperate then this situation is just going to take longer to blow over. Need to strike fear into them somehow.

Maybe they can hire those who lost their jobs during this period to actually monitor this and enforce this? Then fine people or something? idk.",2020-03-27 12:39:04,reddit

"My unpopular opinion is that all these new rules were not properly thought through and hard to enforce. For example eating places need to maintain social distance but what about public transport? The reasoning I heard is that public transport is considered ""transient"". But from what I know, people finish their workday lunch in 15-20 mins and leave while a bus ride is easily 30 mins +. 

That's why I think we might as well bite the bullet and lock down. The Covid situation is fluid and we must adapt, just like how one moment we were told to support local attractions and the next moment to stay at home. Our infection graph was quite nice in Feb but started to spike once the overseas Singaporeans returned.

Singapore is a small country and our enforcement is good. From the generous budget, we know the govt can afford to pay full wages up to median salary for more than 2 mths (ie 25% salary over 3 quarters). With the borders as good as closed, just focus on clearing the virus from SG. Even if our curve has a long tail, I'll bet my last penny it will be shorter than the messy Europeans / Americans and our even messier neighbours.

With things under control, at least life can get back to some normalcy. Everyone will still have to scrape by, some are still screwed but at least we are not in this not-here-not-there limbo. During this time, the govt can also take the time to ponder how we ""leap ahead"" once the virus is over world wide.

Note: If you disagree with my opinion, that's ok. But rebut with thought out opinions and not just personal insults.",2020-03-27 10:11:36,reddit
"> # COVID-19: Fine or jail for not observing at least 1-metre social distancing in public

> SINGAPORE — Those who intentionally sit on a seat or stand in a queue less than one metre away from another person in public venues can be fined up to $10,000 or jailed a maximum of six months, or both.

> Such penalties also apply to those who intentionally sit on a fixed seat that is demarcated as not to be occupied in public venues, as well as those who take part in events held anywhere here with more than 10 participants.

> These and other social distancing regulations, along with penalties, were included in one of several updates made by the Ministry of Health (MOH) to the Infectious Diseases Act.

> These were published in the electronic version of the government gazette at 11pm, Thursday, less than an hour before all entertainment venues were to be closed till end-April.

> The same penalties apply for those who flout other social distancing regulations during the period between 27 March and 30 April, inclusive of both dates. Such regulations do not apply to proceedings of the Parliament or the courts.

> During this period, all events, regardless of size, must be deferred or cancelled, while social gatherings are to be limited to 10 people or fewer at any time.

> Public venues, such as retail malls, museums, and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open but only with precautionary measures in place.

> Separately, all centre-based tuition and enrichment classes have been suspended to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools. All religious services and congregations have also been suspended.

> The scope of violation for the regulations includes:

> This excludes any event that is conducted for business at a workplace or providing education in an educational institution.

> Among the 55 places of attractions that must comply are the Arts House, Asian Civilisations Museum, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Singapore Zoological Gardens and Gardens By The Bay.

> In an earlier update made by the MOH to the Act, patients who are issued a five-day medical leave by a medical practitioner certifying that they have acute respiratory symptoms are not allowed to leave their homes starting on the day the certificate is issued.

> Similarly, those who do not comply and leave their homes during the five-day period will too face a maximum fine of $10,000 or a maximum jail term of six months, or both. They can only leave their homes to seek medical attention.

> The same penalties apply to anyone who flouts the 14-day stay-home notice by leaving the place of accommodation or residence they are serving the notice in.

> Of the 683 COVID-19 cases here, 172 have fully recovered. 18 patients remain in the intensive care unit while two – a 75-year-old Singaporean woman and a 64-year-old Indonesian man – have died.

"> # Two big groups under probe for safe distancing breaches

> Two groups, each comprising 20 people or more, are under investigation for allegedly breaching safe distancing rules at Singapore's nature reserves.

> One involved 26 hikers who had attempted to go off-trail illegally in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, the largest on the island.

> The other was a group of 20 who had gathered for a birthday celebration at Labrador Nature Reserve in the south-west of Singapore.

> Of greater concern is that these two groups are not the only ones being investigated for possible violation of Covid-19 safety measures, nor are they even the biggest group.

> The Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) revealed yesterday that a group of 50 people is also being investigated. The New Paper understands this is the largest group linked to a breach since safe distancing measures were put in place in March.

> Responding to queries from TNP, an MSE spokesman said these incidents are among a spate of recent cases involving 12 to 50 people intermingling in large groups at various parks, birthday celebrations, baby showers, food and beverage outlets, and basketball and football games in Housing Board estate courts.

> These cases are under investigation and the appropriate enforcement action will be taken, she added.

> Noting the recent increase in such gatherings, the spokesman added: ""It is important for all of us to remain vigilant and adhere to safe distancing measures to avoid a resurgence of cases as seen in other countries.

> ""We have been able to keep the number of Covid-19 cases low due to the majority playing their part.

> ""With the festive season coming up, and as we make the transition to phase three, it is even more crucial for us to adhere to these measures so that we can continue to keep our community safe.""

> Under the current phase two of the country's reopening, social gatherings of up to five people are allowed with safety measures such as the wearing of masks.

> The Government has signalled that the country could move into phase three by the end of the year.

> But Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force of Covid-19, reiterated on Tuesday that three criteria must be met for this to happen.

> Two of them are sufficient testing capabilities - in which Singapore is ""proceeding well"" - and a participation rate of 70 per cent in the TraceTogether programme, up from the current rate of less than 50 per cent.

> The third is an overall sense of compliance with safe management measures.

> ""We do need to see Singaporeans taking today's measures seriously because if people are not even responsible enough to uphold (them), then going for further relaxation is going to be very risky,"" Mr Wong stressed.

> Separately, on Tuesday, Minister of Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said on Facebook: ""I am concerned to see an increasing number of flagrant violations of the rules. I urge you to continue to observe the measures to keep your family and friends safe from infection.""

> Infectious disease experts warned that this was not the time for complacency despite the drop in community cases.

> With reciprocal green lanes established between Singapore and countries like Malaysia and Japan and the imminent air travel bubble with Hong Kong, an undetected case of the virus could slip through, Dr Leong Hoe Nam, a specialist at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said.

> ""Our defence of masks and social distancing must hold. If not, we will see a new wave of community spread,"" he added.

> ""I would encourage everyone to not give up the huge gains that we have achieved.""

> Another expert, Dr Ling Li Min, who is also based at Mount Elizabeth Novena, said the recent rise in breaches suggested that people may be suffering from Covid-19 measures fatigue.

> However, she stressed the importance of remaining socially responsible, as studies have shown that gathering in large groups in close proximity results in an estimated secondary infection rate of up to 53 per cent should someone in the group have the virus.

> ""Getting to where we are now with our low community infection rates has been a challenge, and we have seen from the experiences of other countries how easy it is for a new cluster of infections to form,"" she added.

> ""Let us not be tempted to let our guard down now.""

"> # STB investigating alleged illegal gathering at RWS hotel

> Another investigation has been launched over a possible breach of safety measures at a hotel at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS).

> Videos of a group of at least six women and a man were uploaded on social media on Sunday, when they allegedly held a party to celebrate the 33rd week of pregnancy of one of the women.

> Some of the women had uploaded several videos on Instagram, showing themselves play-fighting with pillows and clothes on beds.

> Social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

> Responding to queries from The New Paper yesterday, Mr Chew Tiong Heng, executive director of infrastructure planning and management at the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), said it was aware of the alleged incident and was investigating.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures,"" he said.

> ""Hotels are required to comply with all safe management measures, including ensuring that gatherings do not exceed five people if they are not from the same household.""

> An RWS spokesman said it takes a serious view of non-compliance and requires all guests to be registered with the hotel front desk.

> Safe management measures are highlighted to guests during check-in, and signs are displayed at common areas as a reminder.

> He said: ""We strongly urge all guests to strictly observe and adhere to all safe management measures for the health, safety and well-being of the Singapore community.""

> This is the second such gathering at RWS that has allegedly breached safe management rules in as many months.

> Last month, it was reported that a group of at least 10 people, mostly women, were seen drinking and dining together in a hotel suite there. Investigations over the incident are ongoing.

> A reader tipped off TNP on the latest alleged incident and claimed it involved six women and two men who held significant influence over youth here.

> One of the women involved has about 57,000 followers on Instagram.

> The posts have all been removed from their Instagram accounts.

> Individuals who breach safety measures may be fined up to $10,000, or jailed for up to six months, or both.

> The maximum sentence is doubled for repeat offenders.

> Asked what possible action may be taken if such breaches repeatedly occur at the same location, Mr Chew said hotels that are found to be non-compliant may face closure of its premises.

> Businesses that do not comply may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other forms of assistance.

> Rules for staycations at hotels

> Staycations are allowed at hotels approved by the Singapore Tourism Board and Ministry of Trade and Industry.

> The hotels must comply with existing safe management measures, such as the wearing of masks and practice of safe distancing in public and common areas.

> Gatherings, even those in private rooms and adjoining rooms, must be limited to five persons or fewer.

> The exception is if the gathering consists only of people who have already been living in the same household, each with the same address.

> All hotel guests are required to register themselves and use SafeEntry for entry and exit. The use of TraceTogether is encouraged.

> There must be staggered timings for guests to be at the hotel lobby and at guest facilities, as well as employees at the back-of-house work environment.

"Yep the punishment in itself is unfair to foreigners but its singapore, there has to be a difference between citizens and foreigners, any country would treat their citizens leniently. Yknow, all things considered foreigners are actually treated better here than anywhere else.

And if the expat circle knows how unfair the pubishments are, why break the law? To be safe tell ur friends to follow the law and dont act as if theyre above it",2020-09-25 13:22:26,reddit

None of them are likely to see prison time, especially if they plead guilty.

After they pay their fines the MOM will revoke their employment passes.  It will be unlikely that they get deported - but they don't need to be, extra paperwork that isn't necessary. 

Without being able to work here they will be tourists and as Brits they have 90 days inside the country.  Extension isn't going to be granted.

They will leave.

"To avoid this being misinterpreted - I have no issue with people who break the rules being punished. I have no issue with news outlets publicising that people have broken the rules and will be investigated for doing so. 

However, there’s been enough of these stories now that I think a few things need to be made clear. 

1. If you’re out and about and you are more inclined to take a video or photo of someone breaking the rules because they are a particular race, then that is racist. 
2. If a news outlet publishes more stories about a particular race breaking the rules, pushes a narrative that a certain race breaks the rules more than others, or covers stories about one race in a different way to others (including publishing names or photos) then that is racist. 
3. If stories about people of a certain race are published to bait racist comments, then that is itself racist.
4. If a government enacts policies that require police or ambassadors to visit locations more often because they are frequented by people of a certain race, then that is racist.

"If history were to be accurate here the trials will take place, defendants convicted and subsequently fined.

None of them are likely to see prison time, especially if they plead guilty.

After they pay their fines the MOM will revoke their employment passes.  It will be unlikely that they get deported - but they don't need to be, extra paperwork that isn't necessary. 

Without being able to work here they will be tourists and as Brits they have 90 days inside the country.  Extension isn't going to be granted.

They will leave.

This happened with that group of expats (some were Brits but were a few other foreign nationals also) that were congregating and drinking opening the first week into phase 1, down on boat Quay.

They all paid their fines and hoped life would move on normally - it didn't.

"To avoid this being misinterpreted - I have no issue with people who break the rules being punished. I have no issue with news outlets publicising that people have broken the rules and will be investigated for doing so. 

However, there’s been enough of these stories now that I think a few things need to be made clear. 

1. If you’re out and about and you are more inclined to take a video or photo of someone breaking the rules because they are a particular race, then that is racist. 
2. If a news outlet publishes more stories about a particular race breaking the rules, pushes a narrative that a certain race breaks the rules more than others, or covers stories about one race in a different way to others (including publishing names or photos) then that is racist. 
3. If stories about people of a certain race are published to bait racist comments, then that is itself racist.
4. If a government enacts policies that require police or ambassadors to visit locations more often because they are frequented by people of a certain race, then that is racist. 
5. If ppl of a particular race receive harsher sentences in court then that is racist.

"> # Sneaker enthusiasts crowd Orchard Rd shoe retailer in breach of Covid-19 rules, prompting investigation

> SINGAPORE - Authorities are investigating shoe retailer Foot Locker, following large crowds that gathered on Friday evening outside its Orchard Gateway @ Emerald outlet.

> The Singapore Tourism Board said early Saturday (Dec 5) morning that investigations are under way, as Foot Locker stores have continued to hold events that draw large crowds, despite repeated advisories about crowd management.

> On Friday night, crowds had gathered at its Orchard outlet, apparently for Saturday's release of limited edition Adidas sneakers, which can fetch a tidy profit on the secondary market due to high demand.

> Eyewitnesses saw at least four red Police Tactical Unit anti-riot trucks parked outside 313@somerset mall, and police tape used to cordon off shop fronts. Police officers were also seen dispersing the crowd, which consisted mainly of youths.

> Photos that circulated on social media at about 8pm showed a crowd of around 100 people packed shoulder to shoulder outside the footwear store.

> The crowds were dispersed shortly after 8.30pm after safe distancing ambassadors and police officers arrived, STB said in a statement.

> ""STB takes a serious view of any breach in safe management measures, and will not hesitate to take actions against individuals and businesses that do not comply with them,"" said STB's director for safe management operations Ms Ranita Sundramoorthy.

> Adidas' Yeezy sneaker line, the product of a collaboration between rapper Kanye West and the sports shoe brand, has drawn large crowds in Singapore and abroad during past launches.

> Last June, the launch of the limited edition Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 V created a long queue many hours before the release time at Foot Locker's Jewel Changi Airport outlet.

> Sole Superior Singapore, a sneaker and streetwear community, called on Foot Locker to shift to a contactless system for ""hyped"" - or very popular - releases, and that a traditional queue system ""is not the way during such dangerous times"".

> ""All we need is just one case to create a cluster,"" it said on Facebook. ""Then, inevitably, the public will look at the streetwear community in general in disgust.""

> Adidas Singapore had held an online ballot for Saturday's limited release shoes, but many sneaker aficionados who missed out appeared to have been trying their luck at Foot Locker given the high resale value of the shoes.

>

> Foot Locker Singapore had earlier marketed itself as the place to snag the exclusive shoes.

> ""These trainers are hot - the hype is real...Foot Locker is at the head of the latest trends, so you know it'll stock Yeezy boost trainers online and in select stores,"" it said on its website prior to the launch.

> The Foot Locker Singapore website was down as of Friday evening.

> Netizens took to social media to voice their displeasure at the lack of social distancing among the crowd.

> Former NMP Siew Kum Hong shared pictures of those gathered outside Foot Locker on his Facebook on Friday with the caption: ""Few cases does not mean no cases.""

> Under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament in April, those found flouting safe management measures face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders can be fined up to S$20,000, jailed for up to one year, or both.

"@lawrencewongst It is a shame that lessons have not been learnt from the dormitory outbreak that brought the entire Singapore to a halt unnecessarily. Back then, you had said that the government did not have the benefit of HINDSIGHT. And now when Singaporeans are helping the government to have the FORESIGHT to identify potential cluster outbreak events like the GE, you dismiss it off as not jumping to conclusions and waiting to see if it really happens. The GE timeline was not due until next year, so was it really 'essential' for it to be called at this point in time with the risks of further outbreaks it may clearly cause? I struggle to reconcile this with what you and other Ministers keep preaching about minimising the risks of transmission.",2020-07-17 16:04:33+00:00,instagram

When the gates are opened, it’s gonna be mayhem (proven at midnight of 19june where people rushed in at 12) there’s gonna he a spike in the cases because most peoples mindset is “the rules are lifted and the government says it’s ok, so we won’t catch covid-19”, without actually realising that the problem is still there, just that we are trying to work around it. To be fair I feel like it’s too early if a response from the government because we have just barely gotten control over the situation and i doubt we will be able to hold it. But really, this CAN be a good decision if we still take the measures seriously, safe distancing and wearing masks, because the rules may be gone but the virus isn’t.

Why delete your thread if you did nothing wrong? Singaporeans must be mindful of the different attitudes foreigners have now while they are here.  We extend our hospitality and give them PR. But they should learn to assimilate and also respect our laws.  Going around suggesting that the tape for the circuit breaker be removed easily is an offence by itself. Everyone should work together and not against one another.  Is it that hard to ask? Why Singaporeans can do it but the foreigners can't? Sigh 🤦‍♂️🤡🐓,2020-04-11 02:21:55+00:00,instagram

"Frightening fact on COVID 19 infection:Make no mistake. When loved ones are removed from your home by ambulance because the virus has hit them hard, you are not going to be able to follow them there, sit by their hospital bed and hold their hand. You are not going to be able to pop in at 7.00 pm for visiting hours. They are going to have no one other than exhausted and brave hospital staff to see them through days or weeks of barely breathing through a ventilator until they either die or recover. They are not going to be well enough to text you.You are not going to be able to phone the ward to check in on them regularly (staff will be too busy for that). During that time, they will be completely alone, while you sit at home waiting to hear whether they have made it through.Imagine that person is someone you love dearly. Because it's going to be a reality for many in the coming weeks.And if that person in hospital happens to be you, going through that ordeal completely alone, it would be nothing less than terrifying.Please stay home and only go out if absolutely necessary. Social distancing is imperative right now for your family and mine.Copy and paste to share, I did.",2020-03-25 16:46:36+00:00,instagram

"I’m a resident in Chinatown and both my parents working in the hawker of Chinatown Complex. For the past week, the crowd in Chinatown has been increasing by a lot. Happy that the sales for my parents stall increased. However, wishes that the safety measurement become better. From my observation only 20% of the visitor scan in to visit the hawker and there is no temperature taken. Although it will be a hassle as a resident who stays there as I walk up and down and around at least 4 times a day. But for the health benefit of the people staying and working there and also everyone please improve the measurement. Not to mention a lot elderly stay there. I can stay at home but my parents have to work so they need to be out.Thank you for providing free covid testing for people who work at Chinatown. But this method can only help to spot the virus and prevent it from spreading. How about stopping them to reach the owners?

"Dear Mr Wong @lawrencewongst, this has been happening for many weeks already and people are getting bolder. The general perception is enforcement is weak and random - very hard to get caught. The general public can spot such flouting everywhere! And it leads others to conclude they can do the same. It is also easy to spot people with no mask or not wearing their masks properly. Teenagers are going out together. Even in schools, parents are having social gatherings. And reporting is of no use unless it is circulated in social media.",2020-06-13 05:33:10+00:00,instagram
"Sir, news of the Beijing Xinfadi wholesale market has caught global attention since this morning. In the midst of 10,000 people 3 was initially found to be Covid-19 positive, & in this morning news it went up to 45 positive cases, and still counting. Even the fish chopping boards were found to have Covid-19 virus. Many more wholesalers have already left the wholesale market after their purchases & have gone back to their wet markets in other districts. Sir, we hope your task force seriously reconsider the opening up of phases in such quick time. Beijing being so far away from Wuhan can still raise a storm after 3 months. We are opening up too fast..Sir.",2020-06-13 05:42:24+00:00,instagram

"In my community of homemakers, we have understood and accepted safe distancing measures while in public spaces. But it has not been clear that the message now is that because of evidence of community spread, we are not to gather even in groups of less than ten for casual or recreational purposes. For instance, some think it is acceptable to go with a few friends to window shop to break the monotony of life, or to meet at a restaurant as long as there are not more than ten people, because the message that we should only go to malls on essential errands etc etc and its rationale are not loudly and clearly communicated to the public. People very much desire to cooperate at such a difficult time as this but because new implementations and advisories are ever so fast changing, I feel it is important to state loud and clear in plain terms and esp the rationale behind each stricter level of advisory. Everyone I know wish to help and cooperate fully in this crisis but sometimes we unwittingly don’t, simply because we have not understood.",2020-04-01 02:55:35+00:00,instagram
"Feedback from a Pro Govt supporter : it takes an individual Razer Tan Min-Liang to do this : Produce our own masks (a couple of millions masks each month). Finally someone with ""great common sense"" is doing it. My question is : what are our human resources-rich Govt doing all this while ? What are our top civil servants doing ? What are our agencies EDB TDB A*STAR MTI doing all this while since Feb 18 when Minister Lawrence Wong was mooting with the idea of producing our own masks?. Dear Minister, you are a good & hardworking Minister. But a couple of million masks a month may not be enough. Can our Govt support Razer in (1) help him to expedite in setting up the factory with our ""Govt agencies"" rich resources and industrial contacts (2) our Govt to chip in and ramp up the production scale to at least 15  mil to 30 mil masks a month. This will help create some jobs too. This will help ""boost confidence"" if people are going out in public and our Govt to enforce ""All to Wear Masks"" when in public places, in view of the heightened risks as compared to Jan situation. Especially in MRTs, Buses, Supermarkets etc *News Recap 1 : ST 19 Feb : SINGAPORE - Singapore is looking for new sources of supply for masks and developing capabilities to manufacture them locally as other Asian countries clamp down on mask exports, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong has said.""In recent weeks, some places like Taiwan, Thailand and India have banned or tightened regulations on the export of masks,"" he said in a written parliamentary reply on Tuesday (Feb 18). *News Recap 2 : CNA 1 Apr : SINGAPORE: Singapore gaming company Razer announced plans on Wednesday (Apr 1) to set up an automated face mask manufacturing line within 30 days to produce ""a couple of million certified masks"" each month.

"*Suggestion / Feedback* for ""Enhanced Safe Distancing Measures announced by PM Lee on 3 Apr"" : NTUC FAIRPRICE SHOULD * 1. Set quota purchase by ID basis . Ask NTUC IT to do this. E.g. if S68xxxxxxx buy 2 sets of toilet rolls on 3 Apr, he can only buy another 2 sets say at least 1 week later. Once he makes a purchase, his ID and purchase data will be input by the cashiers / NTUC systems. * 2. Impose this measure : allocate say 60% of ALL your stock SOLELY for ONLINE PURCHASES. Why so ? Simple reason : enhanced distancing measures. If you dont believe, you can go to all NTUC outlets now. Now is 5 30 pm (3 Apr). (after PM Lee just gave his speech). All will scramble to panic buy. This is human behaviour everywhere in the world. This will result in ? Large crowd gatherings at NTUC outlets. This defeats the ""enhanced distancing measures"" purpose.  If there are large crowds formations due to panic buying, the community spread risks will increase (meaning more may be infected. Just like those large crowd religious gathering examples). This is extremely risky and dangerous. But why 60%stock allocation for online 40% for in-store? Cos there are people who dont know how to use computers/ go online etc .

"Dear Minister, good afternoon. I can see that you are working very hard as the Taskaforce Co-Chair,  so thank you for that. As a commoner, I cant formulate policies, I cant contribute much. As an indvidual, I can only help by being ""socially responsible"", which I have been doing since Jan. However, I feel that I can also contribute by giving feedback & suggestions, sharing world info with the Govt & etc. E.g. I shared this info : Japanese Flu drug Avigan was said by China doctors to be effective in the treatment. I am not a doctor, but no harm sharing this info for our medical experts to ""further look into it"". Bear in mind China rarely ""praises"" or ""give words of endorsements"" to Japanese-linked whatever. So today my feedback is : repeated many times. agreed by some in the public : daily MASKS wearing when going out is IMPORTANT for more effective containment. Singpost. It says they do ""daily precautionary checks with temp checking"". Was it very effective ?  After so many weeks, still think it worked like SARS ? All over the world, including ground zero China said carriers may not have fever for days even if they are infected. So, yes temp checking can keep out / contain some with obvious symptoms BUT fail to contain those infected for days without much symptoms such as fever. Is this so hard for our Govt to understand ? By enforcing everyone to wear masks when outside in the public help to minimize the transmission risks, especially from those without fever symptoms. China enforced this and was quite successful. So Singapore, why why why ? Is it because we have not enough masks ? Is making our masks Rocket Science ? Cant our Govt who just budgeted tens of $billions crisis $ allocate $30 mil to assemble a large masks assembly lines to produce a million masks a day ? Cant our Govt employ hundreds of unemployed / laid-offs to work in this mask factory ? An un-infected meeting an infected with both wearing masks = double protection. An un-infected meeting a silent infected with both not wearing masks = Disaster . Think about it. I always wonder what would Lee Kuan Yew do if he were tasked to handle this crisis ?  @leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan",2020-03-28 06:10:53+00:00,instagram

"FEEDBACK : Another ""piece of evidence"" why masks are important in the containment efforts. Latest News 28 Mar (France 24 TV) : "" France has ordered from China, a billion masks"" . If Singapore can quickly assemble a large assembly line(s) for making a million masks a day for Singapore use, by doing so will 1. More effective in our overall containment efforts 2. Create jobs for hundreds / thousands. With enough masks, if we enforce everyone to wear masks in public, this will surely, surely reduce the community transmission. Without such enforcements, silent virus carriers without much symptoms will continue with not wearing masks and move around in public, thus causing more infections. Then what will our Govt do ? More contacts tracing. After sometime, it will become almost impossible to do ""effective contact tracing"" and Singapore will then be at high risks of becoming the next Italy or Spain (sudden spikes in cases, exploded, healthcare system breakdown etc) This is highly possible if our Govt become complacent (means while doing good in some areas but also flawed / overlook in other areas) @leehsienloong @gankimyong @ongyekung @khawboonwan @teocheehean @lawrencewongst",2020-03-28 18:27:24+00:00,instagram
"SCMP latest news article : (QUOTE) "" Why are there so few coronavirus infections in Singapore’s health workers? "" Link :  https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3077345/coronavirus-why-so-few-infections-singapores-health (UNQUOTE) This article in some ways praised Singapore Govt and this will make many Singaporeans proud. However, there is one important info in this article : (QUOTE) "" Experts suggest this has been more than just luck, pointing to a case in which 41 health workers were exposed to the coronavirus in a Singapore hospital yet evaded infection.The workers had all come within two metres of a middle-aged man with Covid-19 who was being intubated, a procedure which involves a tube being inserted into the patient’s trachea. The procedure is seen as being particularly hazardous for health workers as it is “aerosol generating” – patients are likely to cough. The workers had not known at the time that the man had the virus and all were quarantined after he tested positive. However, on their release two weeks later, none of them had the virus. The case has come to widespread attention partly because the workers were wearing a mix of standard surgical masks and the N95 mask, which doctors see as the gold standard as it filters out 95 per cent of airborne particles. “That none of the health care workers in this situation acquired infection suggests that surgical masks, hand hygiene, and other standard procedures protected them from being infected.” (UNQUOTE) See the MAIN POINT  here? Strong Evidence: WEARING MASKS ARE EFFECTIVE PROTECTION. Govt must act fast to produce our own masks, enforce everyone in public to wear masks, this will surely help in the overall containment.

"Feedback : how Italy Spain France Germany etc ""exploded"" in the Covid-19 crisis was mainly due to ""no borders control"". How China with more than 1 billion population managed to have some effective containment was mainly due to domestic provincianal borders control. E.g. they locked down Hubei province, think they also locked down Zhejiang province. Main point : Malaysia Covid-19 crisis situation seems to be getting worse. It would be wise if both countries Singapore and Malaysia work out together to extend the borders lockdown. Figures show that a few hundred thousands of people crossed the borders daily (to and fro). This is extremely dangerous if the infected in Malaysia are much more than what was reported in the news. A few hundred thousands daily crossingsof Malaysia Singapore borders. This is no joke. And our Govt must seriously look into this to avoid becoming the next Italy. Once exploded, no amount of contact tracing can help to do effective containment. Not even lockdown after ""exploded"". Chinese saying : ""No Health No Wealth"" Health comes 1st. When Singapore is still within control, economy though bad is still manageable. BUT if Singapore exploded like Italy, any lockdowns, any closure of public transport, our economy will be much much worse than current (already bad) situation. So our Govt most important task now : to prevent Singapore from becoming the next Italy. At all costs. And the next thing to look out for : borders control with Malaysia. @lawrencewongst @leehsienloong @khawboonwan @hengsweekeat @teocheehean @gankimyong @ongyekung @vivianbalakrishnan",2020-03-23 03:06:35+00:00,instagram
"Feedback : Singapore must do all to prevent itself from becoming the next Italy.  At all costs. Reminder : if Singapore touchwood becomes the next Italy, this would mean the worst Catastrophe in Singapore modern history. Our healthcare system will breakdown. Our economy will be 10X 100X worse than the current (already bad) situation. Indonesia is getting worse and had not hit the peak yet. So is Thailand. So is Philippines. Malaysia is getting worse. ASEAN very likely will explode to become the new Epi Center if ASEAN Govts dont do containment as well as Korea or China. Read this news (source TODAY) : "" KUALA LUMPUR — Doctors, nurses and other medical staff at Malaysian hospitals are treating Covid-19 patients in DIY protection gear made from everyday items like dustbin liners because there is a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).Such self-made gear is clearly inadequate and puts medical frontliners in danger of becoming infected with Covid-19 themselves.At present, 19 medical frontliners in Malaysia have come down with Covid-19, of which 11 are now warded in intensive care."" Singapore must NEVER open borders with Malaysia for at least the next few weeks. A few hundred thousands movements to fro daily. With Malaysia healthcare not up to par, infected Malaysians will flock/self-dump into Singapore if we open borders.

Before the compulsory mask wearing policy, I did not wear any mask, disinfect, frequently wash my hands with soap or sanitise .

I do not follow and do not wear the mask sterilised with Ethylene oxide another cancer causing agent. When the commuters coughed very badly I did not fall sick! I keep seeing the public areas are disinfect! You are making the population inhale poison! Before you can solve COVID 19, you are creating more health problems! Such stupidity will cause astronomical increase in chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases! This is the fallacy of science that always embrace man-made chemicals!

"Stricter COVID-19 measures introduced during Chinese New Year will continue for a few weeks, even after festivities end.

"Lawrence Wong: New rule on 8 visitors a day hard to enforce, EOs will do random spot checks No more than eight. The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

"Imo, should temporary make TT compulsory to carry when outside for the period of CNY and every other festive period. That will be more efficient way to enforce the ""max 8 visitors"" and ""2 household"" rules. After CNY, don't have to make it compulsory anymore. Example, random spot check on people outside whether they bring their TT or install their app or not. If they were caught not bringing nor installed the app, give reasonable fine. Also make temporary update not able to pause the app. The idea is to deter people from lying to contact tracers if any single one of them become positive later. If they're found that they broke the ""max 8 visitors"" and ""2 household"" rules, then send them to jail or fine them. I just don't want repeat of last year.

The new restrictions before Chinese New Year will include a cap of eight distinct visitors per household per day. This is different from the current restriction of eight visitors at one time. But enforcing the rule might be a tad difficult, considering these are houses and not public places. Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) co-chair Lawrence Wong acknowledged that enforcement for this new rule is ""not going to be so easy"". He listed a few possible ways that the enforcement might occur if the rules are not adhered to. Enforcement Officers will do random spot checks, and neighbours might also tell on rule-breakers. In response to a media question, Wong said that random spot checks had been done before, and it wasn't new. However he reiterated that it would not be easy, and called on everyone to cooperate and do their part. Wong also strongly advised those going out to visit to keep it to no more than two other households per day, particularly during the Chinese New Year period.

The restaurant chain will be charged in court on Feb 17 over failing to ensure that the gathering of individuals on its premises did not exceed the maximum group size allowed, not enforcing at least 1m of safe distancing between seated customers, for providing a self-service buffet of food for consumption, and for allowing customers to make speeches and play a video recording in the outlet.

"This came as the authorities stepped up inspections at food and beverage premises, malls and other public spaces over the past week to ensure compliance with safe management measures during the Chinese New Year period. The ministry said 102 individuals and 12 F&B premises were penalised for breaches during the week. Among these, six F&B outlets have been ordered to close, while five outlets and 29 people were fined for breaching safe management measures, said the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) in a press release on Wednesday (Feb 10). A total of 73 individuals were also issued fines for breaching Covid-19 regulations at parks and beaches. As a result of the ramped-up enforcement, crowd size in Chinatown has also shrunk by about 20 per cent compared with the week before, as the enhanced crowd control measures started last Friday, added the ministry. The F&B outlets ordered to close included Ah Yat Seafood Restaurant at 200 Turf Club Road, which allowed a company dinner gathering of 65 people in its restaurant on Feb 6. The guests were seated across nine tables. East Treasure Chinese Restaurant in River Valley Road accepted a group of 16 diners on Jan 29, who were seated across two tables. Investigations revealed that the gathering was a dinner organised by a company for its employees. Both the company and 16 diners will be fined $1,000 and $300 each, respectively. Crystal Jade Jiang Nan at VivoCity accepted a booking for 16 diners from different households and seated them across two tables on Feb 6. Investigations are ongoing. These three restaurants will be closed for 10 days from Wednesday till Feb 19. Ding Garden in New Bridge Road which allowed 13 diners from different households who sat across three tables on Feb 5 has been ordered to close from Feb 6 to 15. The 13 diners, who arrived together, were fined $300 each for gathering in a group larger than eight. Wangzi Music Restaurant in New Bridge Road allowed diners to consume alcohol at 2.30am on Feb 6. It has been ordered to close for 20 days from Feb 6 to 25. Zam Zam in North Bridge Road seated different groups of diners less than 1m apart on Feb 5. The outlet had committed two previous offences in May and December last year and was fined $1,000 and $2,000 respectively. For its February breach, the restaurant has to close from Feb 9 to 18. Four other F&B outlets were fined $1,000 each , and one outlet was fined $2,000 for repeat offences of seating groups of diners less than 1m apart. They are: Chuan Garden at 1 Pagoda Street; Eating House at Upper Cross Street and Jalan Membina; Kim's Family Food Korea Restaurant at Telok Ayer Street; and Sichuan Restaurant at 72 Pagoda Street. Multiple table bookings at F&B outlets for groups larger than eight are strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed. In addition, a total of 73 people were fined $300 each for flouting safe management measures on Feb 6 and 7 in parks and beaches. These breaches included gathering in groups of more than eight people and intermingling between groups. In Changi Beach Park alone, 39 individuals were fined, including 17 who were caught gathering in one group.",2021-02-12 16:53:00,hardwarezone

"Not expert but think have a feeling its going to be a poor implementation of sort (again), where it may become a point of contention for many an argument. Think its will be open to alot of abuse, not because possible exceed quota but because others anyhow report. As can imagine many no brainer would just report when see alot of people even if its within the limit. As they don't know how many people in the household, they just no brainer see way more than 8 means sala to them. Don't forget some household by itself already have many people, add on 8 visitors it then become a big group to the many silly no brainer out there even if they within limit. Thus think that's one problem with it. For lack of better reference, if vaguely remembered, the issue with it could be just like initially the CB safe distancing thingy. Where think if not wrong people are allowed to go out in small group within the family to exercise and such. But then the implementation (and many silly ones out there) fail to see that many such small groups together in parks and such doing so call exercising, even if got safe distancing, also become a large group gathering to the many none the wiser and no brainer third parties. Think if not wrong, many kpkb then about that even though think the different groups by themselves are not doing wrong.",2021-02-12 11:33:00,hardwarezone

"Time and again, Singaporeans read in the news that East Coast Park (ECP) and Changi beaches are overcrowded. I have made my own observation and, interestingly, discovered that the crowds are not well spread out across the few kilometres along the seafront. Most of the crowds tend to gather around the vicinity of the toilets or under a few trees that provide shade. Therefore, to spread out the crowds, the authorities should build more toilet facilities at regular intervals. More shady trees should be planted along the entire stretch of beach, instead of clustering them together. In addition, some snack and drink kiosks, together with kiosks that rent out deck chairs and beach umbrellas, should be provided along the whole stretch of beach, to spread out the crowd and for the convenience of beachgoers. At present, along the beach at ECP, there are a few restaurants in Parkland Green and Marine Cove. There is only one food centre, East Coast Lagoon Food Village, and it is very crowded throughout the day. In order to spread out the crowd, one more food centre should be built in the vicinity of the former Big Splash. The beachfront is one of the most popular playgrounds for families, as it is a cheap and convenient place to cycle and to keep fit. When residents are healthy, it is good for the economy and the country as a whole. Hence, money spent on rejuvenating the beach parks is well worth it. People should be encouraged to go to the beach for more fresh air. Harry Ong Heng Poh",2021-02-11 22:53:00,hardwarezone

"SINGAPORE - From next Tuesday (Jan 26), each household will only be allowed to receive up to eight unique visitors a day, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong on Friday. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households a day, as far as possible. During the Chinese New Year period, people should visit family members only, he added. The tightened measures come on the back of rising community cases after the year-end festivities. ""With more interactions, with more human activities, there is an increased chance of transmission of any infectious disease,"" said Mr Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministerial task force tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Compared to a month ago, our vulnerability has increased, and the situation can escalate very quickly, especially with the likelihood of more interactions taking place over the Chinese New Year period."" Although people will still be allowed to gather outside in groups of up to eight, he stressed that Singaporeans should keep their social circles small. Mr Wong also reminded diners that face masks must be worn when not eating or drinking, adding that voices should not be raised at any time. This means that masks must be worn while tossing the traditional yusheng, with no recitation of the usual auspicious phrases that are said at the time. Enforcement checks will be stepped up during this period, with strict action taken against individuals and business operators that breach safe management measures, he said. He noted that the virus is still raging around the world. Places that have been successful in controlling the infection up until now - such as Taiwan and Hong Kong - are also imposing restrictions on Chinese New Year celebrations, he said. Mr Wong also recounted how Singapore saw a spike in Covid-19 cases after Chinese New Year last year, with multiple clusters linked to such gatherings. That is why the task force is making a pre-emptive move to tighten measures to avoid a repeat of what happened last year, he said. ""Let us be mentally prepared that Chinese New Year this year will not be the same as before,"" he added. ""It will be quieter, it will be more subdued, and we will have to be more disciplined in how we go about our daily activities and interactions."" He stressed that the underlying principle behind the measures is for people to reduce exposure to one another. A surveillance testing exercise will also be carried out for stallholders, shop owners, restaurant workers, as well as food delivery workers operating in and around Chinatown, said the ministry. The two-day exercise will start on Feb 8, with the authorities planning to progressively contact identified groups with further details. ""While there has been no evidence that these community groups are at higher risk of infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be offering tests to them as they are expected to interact more frequently with other members of the public during this time,"" MOH said in a statement. The Government will fully bear the costs of these tests, it added. ""We strongly encourage all individuals in the identified community groups to come forward for testing.""",2021-02-11 13:31:00,hardwarezone

"Quote: SINGAPORE: Showing appreciation to family members this Chinese New Year is ""perhaps more important than ever"" amid COVID-19, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday (Feb 11). ""Chinese New Year is a time for reunions and celebration. Tonight, across Singapore, families will enjoy dinners with their loved ones. Over the next few days, we will visit parents and relatives in smaller groups to exchange New Year wishes for good health and prosperity, and to welcome new arrivals to the family,"" said Mr Lee in his Chinese New Year message. ""The warmth, comfort and support of our families have given all of us strength to get through the most trying times of COVID-19."" But stricter COVID-19 measures are necessary as the coronavirus is still \x93spreading rapidly\x94 around the world, said the Prime Minister. Restrictions on home gatherings have been tightened to no more than eight visitors a day. ""Our own visits should be to at most two other households daily, and only to relatives,"" added Mr Lee. READ: Rules on visiting and tossing yusheng: 7 things to note this Chinese New Year amid COVID-19 \x93This January, we saw the new waves of infection caused by year-end celebrations in many countries, where many people gathered and let their guard down. This is something we should learn from and avoid,\x94 said Mr Lee. \x93I know these restrictions will dampen the festive atmosphere somewhat. Bigger extended families will be especially inconvenienced. But the precautions are essential to keep our loved ones safe. \x93I am sure you will find other ways to hold your reunions and connect with family members and friends, perhaps through video calls or teleconferencing.\x94 People can look forward to \x93more carefree"" celebrations when the pandemic is over, he added. VACCINATIONS FOR WHOLE POPULATION IN 2021 Singapore should be able to offer COVID-19 vaccinations to its whole population within this year, provided vaccine supplies come in as scheduled, said Mr Lee. About 250,000 people in Singapore have already received the first dose of the vaccine so far. \x93We have vaccinated most frontline and essential workers, and are now vaccinating our seniors, starting with those over 70,\x94 said the Prime Minister. READ: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March Mr Lee said he \x93strongly\x94 encourages everyone to take the vaccine when it is their turn. \x93Vaccination protects ourselves, and our loved ones. Furthermore, if enough of us are vaccinated, our population will have herd immunity. \x93But we are not there yet, so in the meantime please keep up our safe distancing precautions, even if you yourself have been vaccinated,\x94 he added. READ: More frequent tests, additional requirements likely for those who do not take COVID-19 vaccine: Lawrence Wong Keeping people safe from COVID-19, especially seniors, has been the Government\x92s top priority, said the Prime Minister. \x93We have gone all out to control the spread of the virus, treat the infected and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, even at great economic cost. Because of this tremendous effort, our COVID-19 situation has now stabilised.\x94 Mr Lee added that Singapore has avoided the \x93disastrous outbreaks and the enormous pain and suffering\x94 experienced by many other countries, and has restarted most of its economy while cautiously resuming cross-border travel. READ: People who need to travel have to wait turn to be vaccinated for COVID-19: MOH \x93As we welcome the Year of the Ox, we can look back and give thanks that we have come through the Year of the Rat, not without trouble, but relatively unscathed.\x94 The Prime Minister also called on people to show their appreciation for healthcare and transport workers, cleaners, migrant workers, delivery riders and other essential workers who are making personal sacrifices to keep Singapore going during this festive period. \x93Many of our Malay, Indian and Eurasian friends will be working, covering for their Chinese colleagues. They deserve our heartfelt thanks,\x94 said Mr Lee. \x93I wish all Singaporeans good health, and a very happy Chinese New Year.\x94 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ssage-14166300",2021-02-11 07:11:00,hardwarezone

"Continued crowd management measures and advisory for festive period There have been heavier crowds over the past weekends in Chinatown. STB, together with relevant agencies and community partners such as the Chinatown Business Association and Chinatown Festivals Organising Committee, has implemented additional measures from 5 February 2021 to better manage the crowds. These measures include not turning on the Chinatown Chinese New Year street light-up from 5 to 7 February and deploying more Safe Distancing Ambassadors (SDAs) and Enforcement Officers (EOs) on the ground. Since 5 February, there has been an estimated 20 per cent reduction in crowd size compared to the week before. STB will continue to work with the relevant agencies to monitor the situation in Chinatown, and will adjust measures accordingly. Around 3,000 SDAs and EOs are deployed daily to enforce Safe Distancing Measures (SDMs) and SMMs at various premises and public spaces, with more being deployed during peak hours, weekends and in hotspots. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action against errant operators and individuals. This includes fines, suspension of operations even for first offences, and prosecution for egregious breaches. We strongly urge members of the public to plan visits to Chinatown and other potentially crowded areas such as shopping malls, F&B outlets, markets, supermarkets and parks, during off peak hours. This will help mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission during the festive period and keep us all safe. We would also like to remind members of the public that households are limited to eight unique visitors a day. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households per day. For the tossing of yusheng, masks must be worn and the lo hei should be done without any verbalisation of the auspicious phrases or toasting. Multiple table bookings at F&B premises for groups larger than eight persons are also strictly prohibited, unless the diners are from the same household. Intermingling across different tables is not allowed. We strongly advise F&B operators to double-check the reservations they have already received to ensure that the bookings are in order. We also urge diners to not try to circumvent the rules, for the sake of their loved ones and the well-being of the community. We will not hesitate to take firm enforcement action. Let us be socially responsible in observing all these measures to prevent a resurgence in community transmission. https://www.sgpc.gov.sg/media_releas...e/P-20210210-1",2021-02-10 13:49:00,hardwarezone

"Crowds still seen in Chinatown despite new measures SATURDAY, FEB 6: Despite new measures, crowding in Chinatown does not seem to have changed much from a week earlier. PHOTOS: CLARISS CHIA, TNP FILE SATURDAY, JAN 30: Despite new measures, crowding in Chinatown does not seem to have changed much from a week earlier. PHOTOS: CLARISS CHIA, TNP FILE Despite new crowd control measures, people still converge on Chinatown to shop and take in the atmosphere Turn off the Chinese New Year light-up over the weekend? Check. Put in new crowd control measures. Check. A lot can change in a week, such as the introduction of the above measures to reduce crowding in Chinatown's shopping precinct after The New Paper reported on shoppers ""rubbing shoulders"" in packed streets and shops two Saturdays ago. What has not changed so much is the crowding in Trengganu Street, Temple Street and Pagoda Street in the wake of the new measures. Though the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) estimated a 20 per cent drop in the crowds compared to the previous Saturday, many people were still too close for comfort in safe distancing terms. In fact, some of them told The New Paper that they had gone to Chinatown because they expected the new measures to reduce the crowding. Housewife Tan Mei Sin, 42, who was there with her husband and their three young children, said they wanted to take in the Chinese New Year atmosphere. ""It's an annual must-do for our family and Chinatown is the best place to come and feel festive. ""Things are already so gloomy. We can't even go to Johor Baru to shop for new year goodies. We decided we would spend about an hour here, have dinner and then leave."" Madam Tan was not alone. Of the 24 people who spoke to TNP, 11 said they were in Chinatown primarily to soak in the atmosphere. Or as one put it, ""just come to feel the vibes"". The new crowd control measure were announced by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) last Friday to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Apart from suspending the light-up over the weekend, they included closing the up-riding escalator at Chinatown MRT station exit A from time to time to manage passenger flow into Pagoda Street. The MSE also urged the public to adapt their Chinese New Year celebrations to ""protect vulnerable members in our community, such as the elderly"" and be socially responsible to prevent a resurgence in community transmission. The Chinatown Business Association (CBA) said on Saturday that barriers were put in place and additional security staff and safe distancing ambassadors would be deployed in crowded areas. Mr Anthony Tan, 56, who was with his 76-year-old mother and their helper, said: ""I promised my mother I would bring her here... like in past years."" The technician added: ""But I made sure she wore her mask properly and sanitised her hands every time we moved from each stall. I find it hard to deprive her from enjoying the festivity."" Noting an estimated 20 per cent reduction in crowd size, Ms Serene Tan, STB's director for arts and cultural precincts, told TNP: ""We thank the public for their understanding and seek their continued cooperation to visit Chinatown during off-peak hours."" The STB also said last week that 34 people have been fined $300 each in Chinatown since Jan 15 for not wearing face masks or gathering in groups of more than eight. In the same period, 11 businesses in Chinatown were fined $1,000 to $2,000 for failing to ensure 1m safe distancing between customers and for allowing gatherings of more than eight people. Most of the shopkeepers approached by TNP said they were fine with the stepped-up enforcement. One of them, who wanted to be known only as Ms Jessica, 50, said: ""I think that it is better this way because I am worried too. ""Our shop received a warning for not controlling the crowd... With the (new) restrictions, it is easier for us to control the situation now."" A security officer for CBA told TNP there is a contingency plan to close off the streets if the crowds became unmanageable. When shown the new photographs of the crowds, infectious disease specialist Leong Hoe Nam said: ""Singaporeans are absolutely becoming complacent... but we can also 'share the cheer' by doing something else. Go outside of Chinatown and tone down the celebration, have fun without the crowds."" Noting that the ability to impose restrictions has its limits, Dr Leong said: ""Can the authorities police everything? I plead for common sense to prevail among the public. ""We all hate it when our parents nag us. And as parents, we hate nagging our kids too. ""I do hope the enlightened Singaporean will rise to the occasion instead of the 'kiasu'one."" https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/cr...e-new-measures",2021-02-09 10:40:00,hardwarezone

"EDMW kum gong kias' logic : If use anti-dandruff shampoo but still have dandruff, it's the anti-dandruff shampoo user's fault because the use of anti-dandruff shampoo causes the dandruff. So : If PAP imposes new measures to reduce crowd at Chinatown but people still goes to Chinatown, it's PAP's fault because the new measures cause people to go Chinatown. If PAP imposes draconian measures to ban people from going to Chinatown and/or forces shops in Chinatown to shut/close, PAP is autocratic and there is no democracy and freedom in Singapore. If PAP does nothing, it is also PAP's fault for not stopping people from going to Chinatown and not forcing shops there to close/shut down. Regardless of what, it is PAP's fault \u5c31\u662f\u4e86\u3002 Kum gong kias are 1 cent a dozen in EDMW. ps.  It is just Threadstarter's own thinking that more people go to Chinatown because they think the new measures will reduce crowd.

"A company that manages the deployment of some taggers, ushers and administrators at Changi Airport will increase the frequency of*temperature taking and disinfecting counters*after one of its employees tested positive for COVID-19.* The 43-year-old Singaporean, who was the country's sole community case reported on Sunday (Feb 7), is employed by BGC Group and works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. His job involves issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice*outside dedicated facilities and helping them to put on these devices. While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). In response to CNA\x92s queries, BGC Group said on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing. \x93BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively-tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,\x94 said the firm.* \x93We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.\x94 MOH said on Sunday that all the man\x92s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period. Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and said there were \x93no breaches\x94. The HR company has about 30 people who are actively deployed in shifts at the airport currently. It*said its employees who are required to be in close contact with incoming passengers are equipped with face shields, masks and gloves. \x93Given that the nature of the job involves potential contact with imported cases, our employees understand the risk factors involved and have to strictly adhere to frequent disinfecting schedules and daily temperature reporting. We clean and disinfect our equipment before and after every passenger is tagged,\x94 said BGC Group. It added that it is awaiting its vaccination schedule as Singapore progressively rolls out doses to more frontliners, including airport staff. The HR firm's Changi Airport project has been*running since August last year. The 43-year-old confirmed case has been with the company for more than four months, it added. Singapore introduced*electronic monitoring devices*in August last year for all incoming travellers serving their stay-home notice outside of dedicated facilities. Those aged 12 and below are exempted from this requirement. These individuals are issued with the*device at the checkpoints*after immigration clearance. They are required to activate the electronic monitoring device upon reaching their place of residence. If the device is not activated as required, the authorities will follow up to determine their location*and assist to resolve any technical difficulties, or take enforcement action, as the case may be. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...evice-14139374",2021-02-09 10:31:00,hardwarezone

"CNY visiting: What happens for large S'pore families with over 30 people & only 8 visitors allowed per day Soft truths to keep Singapore from stalling. PERSPECTIVE: From Jan. 26 onwards, safe management restrictions only allow Singapore homes to entertain up to eight visitors per day. Chinese New Year (CNY) visitations have become a logistical headache for some, especially those with large families. In the week leading up to CNY, we talk to a few Singaporeans to find out how their families have been affected by the measures, and their thoughts on the whole situation. How do you know it's CNY? Perhaps it's when a throng of relatives you hardly see suddenly gather to exchange greetings, niceties and angpows. For me, it's when my entire extended family of over 30 people gathers at my grandmother's place on the first day of CNY. It's like a typical family gathering filled with lots of food and laughter. The only difference? We're better-dressed. But CNY in the midst of a pandemic, however, is looking to be slightly different. Peculiar even. With households only able to accept eight visitors per day, the biggest question is: How will families organise themselves? Of course, it could very well be that a family just decides to cancel CNY and scrap all visitation plans. Me to a friend: ""Hey, how is your family going to celebrate CNY this year ah?"" Friend: Which is perfectly fine. But for most families, mine included, my guess is that they will still try to ensure that some form of visiting still takes place. With over 30 people and only eight allowed per day, some will not get to visit during the first weekend When the announcement on the eight-visitor rule first happened, there was a bit of a scramble in my family's WhatsApp chat. And understandably so, since the implication of the policy meant that not every family would get to visit our grandmother during the first (or even second) day of CNY. My dad has seven siblings, and the majority of which have their own families of one to three kids. Some of these ""kids"" have also gone on to have their own kids. Basically, CNY this year would look vastly different from the CNY celebrations we've known all our lives and the restrictions would require us to do a bit of organising amongst ourselves. We're not alone as well. Tang Mei Yong, 50, told Mothership that their usual family gatherings involve a much smaller crowd of less than 30. But CNY is a slightly different, with over 50 relatives, including those they only see once a year, ""(squeezing) together"". 55-year-old Amy Cheong also told us that there would be around 50 to 60 people ""crammed into ah ma's house"" on the first day of CNY. But due to the virus, Cheong explained: ""If they are uncomfortable with it, because there are still risks, they can choose not to come to visit at all and we will respect their decision."" Who does all the coordinating? Is anybody even doing it? The next logical step is to organise those who wish to visit anyway. But who is to be entrusted with the laborious task of coordinating different families? The most fuss-free method for my family is to make use of an existing WhatsApp chat group so everyone can add on to a running list of who visits when. More importantly, the chat allows everyone to coordinate requests in real-time. (""Sorry, ah ma requesting mahjong kaki (friends) for day 1 so can non-mahjong players swap to another date?""). An illustrative example of a proposed list involving who to visit when, with the number of visitors helpfully indicated in parentheses: (Translation: Day 1: Eldest Brother, Second eldest brother; Day 2: Third brother, fifth brother; Day 3: Eldest Sister) There could be other practical factors influencing who coordinates the entire timetable too. In the case of Cheong, for instance, her sister helps to coordinate since she lives with their mum. But for other families without similar chat groups, this role might simply fall onto the lap of the most organised person in the family, simply by virtue of the fact that this individual is just naturally better at keeping track of things and chasing others for a response. How to decide which family visits when? The next order of business is to arrange who gets to visit when. Which is potentially a real headache when you need to think about the capacity limits, and to also factor in the schedules of multiple families. It could be on a first-come first-serve basis. Like Tang's family, where whoever calls to lock in their timeslot will get to visit first. But other families have other considerations. The daughters on my dad's side of the family were quick to decide on behalf of everyone: ""Let the sons visit first"". Which makes sense when you consider how daughters are traditionally considered 'outsiders' once they get married. After marriage, the daughter would prioritise her husband's family. For Cheong's family, they decided to use age as an organising principle instead, where the families of the older siblings get to visit their mum first. How does Cheong feel, not being able to visit her family during the first week (she will be visiting on the following week instead as she is the youngest sibling)? ""No one is cut out intentionally,"" she told us. ""It's a mutual decision among the siblings."" She also added, with profound reflectiveness: ""The days don't matter. Because we can visit them other days too. If we only visit our parents or grandparents during CNY then siao liao (something has gone wrong). Every day can be chu yi (CNY Day 1). It's the attitude and mindset."" One can accept and understand the rules but still be disappointed A common initial response to the rule is disappointment. Particularly for some older folks, who are used to having large gatherings as a sign of a happy and prosperous family. But despite the emotional response, one gets the sense that people rationally understand the need for having such restrictions. My grandmother, for one, would love to have the whole family over at her place on the first two days (who knew that CNY 2020 would be the last time we all saw one another in the same space at the same time?). But when my dad called her to explain our visitation plans, reiterating the new restrictions, she seemed pretty accepting of it. For Cheong, she pointed out how her mum, who is already 93 years old, was actually hoping to see most relatives during the CNY period. Nevertheless, there is consensus that this rule is ""inconvenient"" but important. ""The house won't be lively anymore. Ah ma likes many people at her house, but we have no choice because of this pandemic. The festive mood is not there but we will make it work with the restrictions. Ah ma is very sad that all of us cannot gather together since she is 93 years old already. She doesn't know how many more CNYs she can celebrate."" https://mothership.sg/2021/02/large-...-to-cny-visit/",2021-02-07 15:22:00,hardwarezone
