"> # Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March

> SINGAPORE: The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) has granted interim authorisation for Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine to be used in Singapore for people aged 18 years and above, it announced on Wednesday (Feb 3).

> The vaccination regime submitted by Moderna requires two doses of the vaccine to be administered 28 days apart.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""HSA’s review of the available clinical data found that the benefits of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine outweigh the known risks,"" said the agency in a press release.

> ""The vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 94 per cent.""

> The first shipment is expected to arrive around March, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).

> Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is the second vaccine to be granted interim authorisation under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR).

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As a precautionary measure, anyone with a history of anaphylaxis or severe or multiple allergies to medicines or food should not receive the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, said HSA.

> 

> Pregnant woman, severely immunocompromised people and those under the age of 18 should also not receive the vaccine as the safety and efficacy data for these groups are not available yet.

> ""Persons who develop anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions to the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine also should not receive the second dose,"" said HSA.

> Advertisement

> The authorities said it will actively review the data submitted by Moderna to ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the known risks.

> When sufficient data is available for full registration, Moderna will be required to file an application to transit the status of the product from PSAR interim authorisation to full registration, said HSA.

> It may also terminate PSAR authorisation at any time; for example, if new data suggest that the benefits no longer outweigh the risks.

"Moderna and Pfizer are very transparent about their data & risks involved. They are willing to provide data to relevant authorities for approval in a particular country.

Sinovac on the other hand, has not been helpful in providing accurate data to fight off COVID. One example can be seen when they confused people with their efficacy of their vaccines and gave reasons like different countries like Indonesia and Brazil gave different two-dose regime (Thus, low % of efficacy compared to China's data). This is the result of a vaccine being rushed into public hands e.g. Sinovac. Without having a plan to provide an ideal two dose regiment timeframe (21 days for Pfizer, 28 for Moderna) from their experts, they publish data that contradicts each other which in turn, loses public confidence and more appropriately, Singaporeans are more wary of taking the Sinovac vaccine, creating much more vaccine hesitancy.",3/2/21,1.0,reddit

Pzifer and Moderna can only manufacture 800k doses per day. Only 6 companies are racing to make vaccines for 2021 and let's say if the other companies manufacture at the same rate of 800k per day.

> SINGAPORE: The SafeEntry digital check-in system, which logs employees' and visitors' entry into businesses to facilitate contact tracing, has been deployed to more than 16,000 venues to date, said the Ministry of Health and Smart Nation and Digital Government Office in a joint release on Saturday (May 9).

> Developed by the Government Technology Agency, SafeEntry requires visitors to scan their identification card so that the system can record their arrival and departure times. The system reduces the manual effort needed by businesses to track visitor movements and eases crowds at entry points, according to the SafeEntry website.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> On May 2, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said businesses allowed to operate from May 12 as part of the Government's easing of COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" measures would be required to use the SafeEntry app.

> ""As a start, deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is higher traffic,"" said the Government in Saturday's joint release.

> ""To date, SafeEntry has been deployed at more than 16,000 premises,"" the authorities said, adding that a list of the facilities where SafeEntry must be deployed from May 12 can be found on the SafeEntry website and will be updated as more activities and services resume.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> Among these venues are workplaces including offices and factories, schools, healthcare facilities, community care facilities, hairdressers, supermarkets, popular wet markets, malls and hotels.

> SafeEntry will also be progressively rolled out to taxis from May 12 to better support contact tracing for street-hail trips.

> Retail outlets such as convenience stores and pharmacies, as well as take-out F&B outlets, are not required but encouraged to use SafeEntry.

> ""Employees and visitors should check in and check out of workplaces and other venues using SafeEntry to help our contact tracers establish cluster links and transmission chains.

> ""It is important that everyone plays their part and uses SafeEntry, so that we can collectively prevent new clusters from forming,"" the release added.

"All iPhones already come with QR scanning functionality built into iOS. I am sure it’s the same for android.

"I'm from Singapore and I live in the US for most of the year nowadays. Singapore housing is waaaay cheaper than the Bay area.

What you're looking up is a ""Good Class Bungalow"", which in laymen's terms is...a mansion. In the middle of a major city. To count as a GCB the lot (land, not interior) must be over 1400sqm, or 15,000 sqft, and on top of that it must be in one of a few select locations that are particularly desirable. For the record, Dyson (of vacuum fame) has a GCB in Singapore. So did the Saudi embassy, but they sold it. Might have been too rich for their blood./s I mean, look at who's selling the GCB you linked. It's Sotheby's. [The Sotheby's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s).

For a comparison of housing affordability, see: http://www.demographia.com/dhi.pdf
The median house price in Singapore is 4.6x the median household income. This is comparable to Salt Lake City and Durham, NC. In San Fran, it's 8.4. It should be noted that most people live in flats and condos, but that's par for the course in any large city. If you're ok with SF housing costs, you'd be fine in Singapore.

I keep using norovirus as an example of a virus that is not airborne and is not spread by droplets that can spread so quickly. Norovirus (common stomach bug) has had the ability to infect an entire cruise ship in days and cripple the thing. Its solely through vomit particles on surfaces, or fecal matter on surfaces. It can live for up to 2 weeks there, and even after a person is no longer showing symptoms, they excrete the live virus via fecal matter for up to 2 weeks. Thats how that one spreads so fast.

According to that glossary, you could say they're nearly the same.  The way I use them (I'm not a health professional) is different.  Bathroom spray is an aerosol.  It's a fine mist in the air that eventually falls out of suspension.  It's not going to travel out a window and down the street.

"I'm pretty sure you are wrong.

Aerosols start out as tiny water droplets, they will dry in air in under 1 second and leave behind a sub micron husk of solid material which virus can stick to. These tiny solids, being so light can float in air for hours and can be easily carried by air movement. Almost anything you do, including breathing will release aerosol, but aerosol is particularly heavily released when doing things like intubation.

Large droplets like a spray or what people release when they cough are much larger and will land on the ground in several seconds due to gravity, they do not travel nearly as far and is not really considered ""airborne""",28/2/20,1.0,reddit

SARS-CoV-2 is definitely spread by respiratory droplets, those are the big droplets hence the 6 ft thing.

Outside of that setting though aerosol transmission is not likely to be a serious danger with SARS-CoV-2.

17.     Case 50 is a 62 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID.

18.     He reported onset of symptoms on 7 February and had sought treatment at two GP clinics on 7 February, 10 February and 11 February. He was admitted to NCID on 11 February and was immediately isolated. Subsequent test results confirmed COVID-19 infection on 12 February morning.

19.     Prior to hospital admission, other than going to work at DBS Asia Central at Marina Bay Financial Centre (12 Marina Boulevard), he had stayed at his home at Mei Hwan Drive, except to seek medical treatment.

No links to other clusters, no recent travel to China.

Edit to add he does have a link to one of the new cases—now—case #55

>>14.     Case 55 is a 30 year-old male Singapore Citizen with no recent travel history to China. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 13 February morning, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. **He is a family member of Case 50**.

(Case 55 gets diagnosed one day after his family member—might have been no to low symptoms—because— they don’t report him seeking medical attention like the others.)",13/2/20,0.0,reddit

"I’ve gotta say. Living in Korea I’ve seen a good response from the korean government as well. Free masks at subway offices and free handsanitizer too. Expansion of testing facilities and clear explanations of what to do if you have symptoms. I’m not sure who’s following whose example but Korea’s been putting out the same type of reports following cases and their whereabouts from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization. Can’t say the same so far of American media, maybe it’s the fact that both are relatively small countries but Korea’s been on top of tracking and reporting the information. 

On the other hand Korea’s still not yet blocked flights from China and there are some other complaints about giving foreign tourists money for quarantine compensation. Korean people are heavily criticizing the government but overall I feel like the response has been organized.

"I do agree about the expanded testing. I suspect a lot of cases in other countries are also similar, in that they have never been to China and have symptoms, but the reason why we're seeing more cases in Singapore is due to how extensively traced each individual is and the fact that the country has the resources to really go ham on the testing. For instance, some of the other countries like Thailand where Chinese travellers still are not yet banned, doesn't have that many reported cases, but that's probably just cos some of the cases are not even tested.",9/2/20,1.0,reddit

> The case involved a 43-year-old Singaporean man who works at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3. He was the sole community case reported on Sunday.

> His job involved issuing electronic monitoring devices to people who will be serving stay-home notice outside dedicated facilities. He also helped them put on the devices.

> While on duty, he wears a surgical mask, face shield and gloves, MOH said.

> BGC Group told CNA on Monday that the infection was detected during a routine, bi-weekly swab, and that he had tested negative in the prior round of testing.

> “BGC Group will continue to closely monitor the health of 12 negatively tested employees who have been in contact with our affected employee,” said the firm.

> “We are treating this unfortunate first incident very seriously and BGC Group will be increasing the frequency of temperature taking to a three-hourly reporting. Our frequency of disinfecting our counters will also be strictly stepped up so to ensure an even safer environment for all employees under our care.”

> Since the man's positive test on Feb 5, BGC Group has reviewed its healthcare and safety standard operating procedures and found “no breaches”.

> The man’s identified close contacts, including his family members and co-workers, have been isolated and placed on quarantine. They will be tested at the start and end of their quarantine period.

> As of Tuesday, Singapore has reported a total of 59,732 COVID-19 cases and 29 fatalities from the disease.

"Yes and no. Our migrant workers (\*in the construction sector, i.e. those being isolated at the moment) make up \~5% of our entire population. Herd immunity is only possible once 70-90% of the population has been infected. With our healthcare capacity, that would mean many more deaths if we rush this. Do remember that we have migrant workers who have died due to non-covid19 reasons (even though they were diagnosed with it). The more our healthcare capacity is stretched, the more people will die or suffer. We can't just keep looking at the covid-19 related death toll.

If the foreign workers remain isolated, it's likely that they'll achieve herd immunity within that population. We can't tell, conclusively, if someone can get covid-19 more than once.

Here's a good article that explains herd immunity well  [https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity](https://www.healthline.com/health/herd-immunity#natural-immunity)

Countries that do ultimately succeed in containing the virus will be attractive destinations for people and businesses to move to (e.g. I live in the US and am strongly considering relocating somewhere).

Would you say you wouldn't be stressed out and uncertain about the future if you lost your job today and have no idea when you'll get another job? Now add an entire family to the mix, with multiple people you need to feed. This is going to add to the mental tolls of a lot of people. 

Moreover, we're already seeing a reversal of close to 20 decades of progress wrt to economic development. 1B people who we got out of abject poverty are about to re-enter poverty (there are defined levels for poverty if you were wondering). Not to mention the 130mm++ people who are now projected to be food insecure as a result of the lockdowns. 

Looking at this in a Singaporean context, Singapore is not big enough to sustain itself. My dad works in the O&G industry, and it is currently getting absolutely ravaged by lockdowns across the world. The O&G industry makes about 20% of Singapore's GDP. Now you have to understand that most industries are interconnected. If one fails, it'll drag down other industries along with it. For example, my bank is projecting a fair number of job listing portals to go bankrupt soon. Why? Lack of job postings. If the airline industry fails, it'll drag the entire hotel industry, car rental industry, tourism industry etc etc along with it.

Moreover, supply chains being ravaged is definitely not going to bode well for a tiny island that exports most of its food. 

This entire situation is not quite as simple as lives vs economy. We're on the verge of destroying the QOL for a large segment of the world population real soon for the next decade if things don't change. There is no script for a massive depression in this interconnected world. It's going to be real bad. Plus you gotta understand the the one thing that has prevented multiple countries from imploding or going to way with one another was money. Take that away and we're facing even more death and suffering.

There are fates worse than death. The best course would be to tell the old and vulnerable to quarantine and let the rest get on with their lives (especially given that fatality rates for those below 70 is 0.08% according to a Danish study and even lower for even younger people).

We rip the bandaid off and resume as normal. It’s great for the economy. But the hurt has to come later, the hurt comes later when healthcare services are overworked, people panic buy, refuse to leave; straight up don’t go to their work because the choose is stay home away from everyone else. Business fail because a majority of their workforce are sick. People won’t go outside where it’s a bloody pandemic going on that people are dying from.

First off, since you seem to have never done NS or is a foreigner, NS men goes through basic training, vocational training, operational readiness assessment and military exercises. All this takes up a good year or so of the NS life, after attaining operational readiness would be the guys on standby in times of war. By the time all that is over the unit is almost ready to ORD. Obviously since the training time has now been cut, our manpower 1.5 years from now would be compromised due to the delay training now. However assuming a delay of 3-4 months training, most of the recruits who had their training delayed today would still be operationally ready by that time. It's a crisis situation, a compromise of sorts is expected

2ndly I already pointed out, everyone is being ravaged by the virus, even it if goes away over the next few months, our potential aggressors will still have to due with an impending recession. They won't have that kind of time, money and energy to deal with us

3rd, there is good reason why we keep a huge reservist force and why we do ICT for so long. In the event where manpower is an issue, the reservist can be called up

"The virus has started spreading :OOOOO

The latest confirmed infected individual had visited gardens by the bay, marina bay sands, and orchard, which are all VERY CROWDED places. I believe there are infected individuals walking among us whom Sg can't find by tracing because how will they know who visited all those three places at the same time???

It's a critical period for Singapore. Let's play our part by taking extra precautions and going to the hospital when you have a fever. PLEASE do not assume you just have a cold and infect more people.

For those who have managed to buy the masks, please do share with others who couldn't buy them cuz some stores went out of stock. Sharing is caring :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: The reason why I said it has started spreading since there are a few of you questioning it, it's just my belief. I'm not trying to scare anyone. This is just my personal opinion, you can choose to disregard it. For those interested, here are my reasons why:

The first man to have been confirmed to have the virus, in Singapore did probably get infected in Wuhan, but his son didn't show any symptoms until his dad was tested and after he was quarantined, which could mean that he got it from his dad after arriving in singapore(honestly this point doesn't matter). What it means is the fact that there is a possibility people could get infected from him despite him staying inside the hotel this entire time(possibly the hotel staff or the cleaning staff who came in contact with their room. What about the people at the airport? At that time, he didn't have any fever so he could have had a few interactions with other people?). But I doubt this will be an issue since they were isolated soon after.

And the fact that the third case, a lady from Wuhan didn't show any symptoms till arriving in Singapore means that most who could have been possibly infected could show symptoms at a much later time from the time they were in contact with an infected person(in her case, probably a day or two since she left Wuhan). This just means that there is a high possibility someone could have been infected during the time she was strolling around Singapore and wouldn't know about it till a week or so later when he/she start showing the symptoms.

The fact that Singapore has disclosed the whereabouts of all three cases since they had arrived in Singapore could also mean they haven't excluded the possibility of Singaporeans/travellers getting infected from these people at the places they have been to. They want us to be careful and be aware.

If you all just want to believe in statistics, go ahead. I trust in Sg stats since they are openly telling us a lot of things. But if you are like me, you would probably think, stats are only showing reported cases. What about the unreported cases?

"> # Two more people test positive for Wuhan virus in Singapore; Total of 3 confirmed cases: MOH

> SINGAPORE: Two more people have tested positive for the Wuhan virus in Singapore, bringing the total number of cases to three, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Jan 24).

> The new patients include the 37-year-old son of the first confirmed case, MOH said in media briefing on Friday afternoon.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> The second new confirmed case is a 53-year-old woman from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore on a Scoot flight at 5.30am on Jan 21, and developed a fever, cough and chills in the afternoon, said MOH.

> She sought medical attention at Raffles Hospital the next day and was later taken to the emergency department at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, where she was immediately isolated.

> MOH was notified of a suspect case at 3am on Jan 23. The woman subsequently tested positive for the virus at midnight.

> The woman stayed at J8 Hotel and visited Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay, MOH said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> She is currently warded at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and is in a stable condition.

> There have been a total of 44 suspect cases in Singapore; the patients are aged between 1 and 78 years old. Thirteen of them have tested negative.

> The latest update comes after Singapore announced on Thursday its first confirmed case, a 66-year-old Wuhan resident who arrived in Singapore from Guangzhou on Jan 20.

> He is in isolation at the Singapore General Hospital and in a stable condition, authorities said.

> Contact tracing has been initiated to identify about 30 people seated near the man during his flight to Singapore. His nine travel companions have also been identified. One of them was his 37-year-old son, who is now confirmed as having the virus. The other eight have left Singapore.

> The man stayed at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort and Spa and indicated that he kept within the hotel vicinity.

> The news of Singapore's first confirmed case came a day after Health Minister Gan Kim Yong announced the formation of a multi-ministerial task force to deal with the situation.

> Authorities also announced on Thursday that border screening will be expanded to all land and sea checkpoints, while a travel advisory has been expanded for Singaporeans to avoid travelling to Hubei province, where Wuhan city is located.

> Earlier on Thursday, schools in Singapore sent out a notice to parents asking that they declare their travel plans for the Chinese New Year weekend beginning on Friday.

> Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot has cancelled its daily flight to Wuhan as a precautionary measure.

> Singapore businesses with a presence in Wuhan have also taken measures. ST Engineering, which has rail projects in Wuhan, has stopped all business commutes there.

> On Friday, China reported that the number of people infected by the SARS-like virus had exceeded 800, with 25 deaths.

> The National Health Commission said authorities were also examining 1,072 suspected cases of the virus that first emerged in central city of Wuhan.

> The markedly higher numbers were released just hours after the World Health Organization called the outbreak ""an emergency in China"", but stopped short of declaring the situation a global health emergency.

> China has effectively quarantined more than 20 million people across Wuhan and some nearby cities in response to the virus, and announced measures to curb its spread nationwide as hundreds of millions of people began travelling across the country this week for the Chinese New Year holiday.

> Streets and shopping centres in Wuhan, a major industrial and transport hub, are now eerily quiet after authorities told residents not to leave the city of 11 million, where most of the cases have been identified.

> The virus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan. That market has since been shut down.

> The virus has spread to Beijing, Shanghai and Chongqing, as well as provinces in northeastern, central and southern China.

> Across the world, confirmed cases have also been reported in Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.

> SINGAPORE: A fifth case of the Wuhan virus has been confirmed in Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in a statement on Monday night (Jan 27).

> The confirmed case is a 56 year-old female Chinese national from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with her family on Jan 18, the authority said on Monday.

> “She is currently warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) and her condition is stable,” MOH said.

> The Chinese national was “asymptomatic” during her flight to Singapore, MOH said, adding that she later developed symptoms on Jan 24 and taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Jan 26.

> “She was classified as a suspect case and immediately isolated at NCID,” MOH said.

> “Subsequent test results confirmed Wuhan coronavirus infection on Jan 27.

> Advertisement

> “She has no known links to the other confirmed imported cases.”

> MOH said on Monday at noon, 62 of the suspect cases tested negative for the Wuhan coronavirus, and four tested positive. The fifth case involving the 56 year-old female was confirmed at 2pm.

> Test results for the remaining 57 cases are pending, the health authority said.

> As of Monday at 12pm, MOH identified 115 close contacts from the first four confirmed cases. Of the 86 who are still in Singapore, 75 have been contacted and are being quarantined or isolated.

> The authority added efforts are ongoing to contact the remaining 11 close contacts.

> “Contact tracing for the confirmed cases is ongoing. Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts,” MOH explained.

> “As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient.

> “In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.”

> The deadly virus has killed 81 people in China so far, with more than 2,700 confirmed cases.

> Earlier on Monday, a newly formed multi-ministry task force announced Singapore will have a new set of stringent measures in an effort to contain the Wuhan coronavirus. These measures include enhanced temperature screening and leave of absence for some.

I really don't get this sentiment eh. China itself has been willing to lockdown entire cities to prevent the virus from spreading. Why would they be offended by us parroting the CCP's behaviour? 

So many Asian countries are doing this, if Carrie Lam is willing to do it for even Hong Kong, of all places, surely that means most of these governments do not perceive border-shutting as something that might incite CCP wrath?

"It may not be 10% at once. The snapshot numbers may make it seem like 10% of all cases become severe, but there are a few other factors too: 

1. Even Singapore doesn't get 100% of the cases, so there could be some mild cases that slip under the radar, making whatever ""found"" cases seem lower, but the severe cases as a % may be higher. 
2. The numbers on most websites show total cases. Some might recover faster, or are in the process of recovery before they are found, and others might have recovered but still be counted as an infected case. 

Thus, it may be 10% based on total patients at a quick glance, but may be higher. That said, I'm not a medical professional, just someone who's too free and keep looking at the numbers daily.

"Edit: Title of article has been modified by the author; it is now “Benefits of mask use by healthy people topic of debate in Singapore”

—-

SINGAPORE - In an ""utopian situation"" with an infinite supply of masks, everyone wearing one regardless of their health status will help contain the coronavirus swiftly.

But as this is not possible, and given the Covid-19 outbreak is a ""marathon"", healthy people under the age of 60 should not wear masks on a daily basis, infectious diseases expert Leong Hoe Nam told The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 1).

The day before,The New York Times reported that the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was reviewing its guidelines on who should wear masks.


On Monday, Austria made the wearing of masks in supermarkets mandatory in a bid to stem the spread of the virus. The Czech Republic went a step further, making mask-wearing mandatory outside of the house.

Readers had also written in to ST asking that people be advised to wear masks despite not showing symptoms.

At a media conference on Tuesday, the Health Ministry's (MOH) Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said the ministry was looking at evidence ""very carefully"" and conducting a review of its stance on masks, as it does with its other policies.

""As far as masks are concerned, we are in fact in the process of continuing to review the data that's available, both in the literature as well as the international experience,"" he said.


He added that recommendations would be made after the review is completed.

Dr Leong, who practices at Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital, said on Wednesday the need for everybody to wear a mask regardless of their health might eventually be a requirement if Singapore is unable to control the spread of the virus here.

But, he noted, masks are still in short supply around the world.

"" I think it's a moot point to get people to wear masks when they're still in scarcity. It's like telling the poor, the way to get out of poverty is to get more money - but I don't tell you how to get that money,"" he said.

""The mask situation has improved, but we're not seeing endless supplies of masks. If all of us had to mask up today for one week, we might finish all our stock of masks immediately.

""The real science of it is, if everyone maintains their 2m distance, watches their hand hygiene, doesn't go out when they're sick, then we may not even need the mask. By keeping 2m away, I would have done what the mask can do,"" he added.


Those older than 60 can use a mask when they go outdoors as they are more vulnerable, he said, adding that they also have to bear in mind the need to conserve their own supply of masks as the outbreak may last for another six to nine months.

Infectious diseases expert Paul Tambyah from the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine said at the moment, data on mask use is not entirely clear.

He noted that new data suggests the receptor for the virus which causes the Covid-19 disease, may be present in the nose and not just in the lungs.

""If this is confirmed, then (using) something which covers our noses may turn out to be important,"" he said, adding that more information would likely be available in a week or so.

Dr Wong Tien Hua, family physician at Mutual Healthcare Medical Clinic, said there is a need for ""situational usage"" of masks at the moment.

""On the bus, on the MRT... when you're queuing up or in a crowded place, wearing a mask is the smart thing to do,"" he said.

He noted, however, that Singapore has taken a multi-pronged approach to fight the virus, including using social distancing measures and closing down entertainment outlets.

""If you tell everybody to wear masks, it's kind of missing the point, because we have other measures,"" he said.

Another family physician, Dr Leong Choong Kit of Mission Medical Clinic, felt that getting everyone to a mask up might backfire.

""If mass wearing of masks is advised, the cost of masks will rise again and the public will buy them from unreliable sources. If they are of dubious quality, they will not serve their function. So it will end up as a futile attempt to control the virus,"" he said.

There is no need for a blanket call to mask up unless there is more community spread here, he added.

A growing number of people online had also called for people to make their own face masks from improvised materials.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam noted that cloth masks have proven to be less effective than proper surgical masks. However, he added: ""But I believe it confers some advantage rather than none, so if I couldn't get a decent surgical mask, I'd use at least a cloth mask.""

Dr Wong said: ""Wearing any kind of barrier is better than no barrier, especially for those who are talking or sneezing.""

But Prof Tambyah and Dr Leong Choong Kit disagree.

""Wearing an ineffective mask is far worse than not wearing one,"" said Dr Leong.

""If I do not have a mask at all, I will consciously avoid certain places, but i f I were to wear one, I may be less conscious and put myself at risk.""

Prof Tambyah said very few studies had tested different types of masks in clinical settings, and he did not know of any that involved patients coughing or sneezing.

""I don't think we should be specifically encouraging people to make their own masks, until there is good objective data on how effective such masks are under clinical conditions,"" he added.

No data exist yet that suggest asymptomatic transmission should be a concern, said the infectious disease experts.

Prof Tambyah said that while epidemiological data may suggest that people could be infectious the day before their onset of symptoms, more detailed molecular evidence had not yet been publicised on these cases.

Dr Leong Hoe Nam said that while asymptomatic cases of transmission may exist, they play a ""very, very small"" role in the transmission of the virus.

""If the epidemic were driven by many asymptomatic transmitters, the Chinese authorities wouldn't have been able to control it so quickly,"" he added.",1/4/20,1.0,reddit

"For those worrying about the safety, here's the Pfizer press-release,

>To date, the Data Monitoring Committee for the study has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. A review of unblinded reactogenicity data from the final analysis which consisted of a randomized subset of at least 8,000 participants 18 years and older in the phase 2/3 study demonstrates that the vaccine was well tolerated, with most solicited adverse events resolving shortly after vaccination. The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2. Consistent with earlier shared results, older adults tended to report fewer and milder solicited adverse events following vaccination.

And here's the Moderna one:

>The interim analysis included a concurrent review of the available Phase 3 COVE study safety data by the DSMB, which did not report any significant safety concerns. A review of solicited adverse events indicated that the vaccine was generally well tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. Grade 3 (severe) events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first dose included injection site pain (2.7%), and after the second dose included fatigue (9.7%), myalgia (8.9%), arthralgia (5.2%), headache (4.5%), pain (4.1%) and erythema/redness at the injection site (2.0%). These solicited adverse events were generally short-lived. These data are subject to change based on ongoing analysis of further Phase 3 COVE study data and final analysis.

You usually expect any safety signals to manifest themselves with 7-21 days from the last dose received and from a safety perspective, they appear to be well tolerated.

"I'm not a HCW, or working on the frontlines.

I am still on the fence because there are so many conflicting information that I am picking up all over.

Given that both Pfizer & Moderna are mRNA-based vaccines and their phase 3 results / data are released at about the same time with similar effectiveness, it gave me a bit more confidence initially.

However I am really a bit alarmed with how UK managed to approve the Pfizer one so quickly. Am interested to see how they roll it out starting from next week, if what they claim is true. And how they botched their response (have some colleagues in the UK) plus the errors with initial results and data from AstraZeneca undermines confidence in them recently.

I sure hope that other countries that do not have the virus under control are now not under pressure (especially looking at USA) to quickly approve vaccines without going through all the necessary processes.

Locally, virus situation considered calm (and I hope it remains that way for a long time), HSA will not be under pressure to confirm quickly. I do think the review will be done thoroughly and let's see what details are released finally.",4/12/20,1.0,reddit
"Not in a rush. Don't see the need to rush for it honestly.

Singapore has handled the situation well after initial blunders. Let the world show if the vaccine is effective and whether it's the silver bullet to solve the crisis.

I fail to see what benefits I get out of it unless I'm working in a healthcare front-line job.

I see people online (not specifically here) commenting about how desperate they are for the vaccine so they can travel. That kind of reasoning just irks me. Even once vaccine rolls out, it will take months to a year before we can assess if the virus is under control.

I'm sure Singaporeans can wait a bit longer and let the countries STRUGGLING to get the vaccine first. Our single digit cases does not warrant a rush for vaccines.",4/12/20,1.0,reddit
"Honestly I'll wait for a few months or so first, ok idk if I'll get flamed but I feel that as compared to the development of other vaccines I feel like this one is relatively more rushed hence if there were to be additional side effects, it may not be visible till say maybe a year later for example? I myself have a weaker immune system though I should be considered young and healthy for my age group, but because of this I'll wait and seek a doctor's opinion first. 
I know how vaccines are tested, manufactured and all and that there's volunteers who go to take the jab and they're fine, but with cases such as dengvaxia in Philippines for example, I guess this is why people are quite concerned about the potential effects hence they aren't willing to go for the jab. ( it's really not about anti vaxxers or what, everybody's body is made different and there are also health conditions that people may have which may induce even worse side effects hence they may have to rely on herd immunity) 
With that being said I acknowledge such incidences are like minority, most vaccines are quite safe and I would very much rather have people who are at higher risk of infection such as health-care workers and the elderly have the injection (of course, subjected to MOH's advisory too). In the meantime I just hope people keep it up with the proper hygiene thing, mask wearing, safe distancing and all, not everyone can be vaccinated and it can take quite some time for herd immunity to take effect too 🙏",4/12/20,1.0,reddit

"I think you are being naive and don't know how the real world works.

I do prototype testing, and I always release preliminary results immediately after the test to my supplier, my design team, my project team and production team. This is so that everyone can effect their plans immediately. The proper and presentable are only released later which takes a few weeks after the test. Production is not going to wait 2 weeks for me to get my report ready when the completion timeline is tight.


Unless the results are marginal, then I will hold back everything and study the results in depth. What is the difference between 90 or 95? The expected rate for vaccine is 60% for a typical flu vaccine.

Firstly, there is no such thing as a perfect vaccine or a perfect drug. There will always be side effects and people  that will be allergic to or not responsive to it. One of the worlds most common drug - Paracetamol (Panadol) has an efficacy rate of 97%. Are you going to stop taking it? The decision to take them are often weighed by side effects against benefits. The side effects at the moment seem to be pretty manageable.

Even if there is a ""perfect"" drug, no one in science will come out claim that it is because that is no such thing as 100% in science. Are you even in healthcare or pharm? Your claim of Pfizer marketing ploy 90%-95% also falls flat because of you don't understand the matric that determines the results. Numbers in this are tied heavily to the number of individual tested. When they released the 90% efficacy rates, testing was probably on-going because you cannot immediately determine the 43000 individuals results at the same time.

"Mechanically speaking, mRNA vaccines seem very safe.

Ideally, they prefer specific immune cells, make virus proteins using the host cell machinery using a natural and quickly degraded information carrying molecule.

mRNA cannot integrate into the DNA, neither can it propagate itself. All it can do is tell your protein making machinary to make proteins based on the information encoded on it. The carriers of these mRNA are not viral particles, but rather bubbles of fat molecules, and I read some paper somewhere that says it can be designed to concentrate on the lymphatic system (important in generating immune response).

There’s no chance for the virus to reactivate itself, which is rare but not impossible for weakened virus vaccines, since there is no virus involved. There’s no risk of finding small amounts of intact virus like in inactivated vaccines with poor quality control, because there is no virus involved. Unlike a weakened virus vaccine, the mRNA fat bubbles aren’t going to go into the usual tissues or organs that the virus targets and risk provoking unwanted immune reactions there, since it contains no virus specfic proteins or receptors on the bubble, the proteins that help to direct the virus to its target, because once again, *no virus involved*.

It is synthetic. It’s not harvested using virus particles.

However, its not entirely without risk. One risk I came across was that apparently some COVID viral protein resembles the body’s own proteins, and in some severe covid cases, the body overreacted and was tricked into targeting friendly cells. If the mRNA vaccine manufacturer chose the right protein target, then this is unlikely. Also, if they unluckily chose that allegedly troublesome protein, you would have seen much more cases of severe effects as compared to placebo in trials. If they get it right, you won’t ever come across that unlucky protein. In comparison, you can’t guarantee that in vaccines using destroyed virus fragments or weakened versions of it, because one can be that unlucky.

Some drugs can cause long term side effects because you take it long term and it targets a certain important function in the body, which may be important in some way that wasn’t predicted. But the Pfizer one which we have right now does not do that. It doesn’t target any cellular function and it is unlikely to do so, and the most likely consequences are immune related ones. And as mentioned earlier, the mechanism of this type of vaccine would have made it more preferable than other traditional types of vaccine.

I don’t know you, but I would take those mRNA ones over those weakened or dead virus vaccines.",23/12/20,1.0,reddit

"Long term side effects usually comes from long term use of a medication. It happens because the way modern medicine works. 

The body has lots of natural processes going on. Some of this processes, when out of “balance”, can lead to disease. Drugs target aspects of such biological processes to bring it back to “balance”, sometimes by blocking it, sometimes by enhancing it. 

Drugs are *small* molecules. The body doesn’t care about the atoms making up the molecule, the body cares about the *shape*. These specially designed drug molecules go into the protein (or other molecules) and do its “magic”, affecting the natural biological processes and bring it into balance.

One problem with this is that the body sometimes likes to reuse the same protein (or family of similar proteins) in different places to control different processes. A drug may unintentionally affect an otherwise unintended process(es) and cause long term unforseen problems.

Another problem is that a drug can target some completely unexpected target. As I said earlier, the shape is important. While a drug can be designed to fit a certain protein, there is chance that by coincidence, it can also hit some unrelated protein elsewhere and affect other processes and cause problems in the long term.

Also, ultimately, all drugs are poison and the only thing that differentiate medicine from poison is the dosage. Too much of an effect can be bad. There are drugs that can cause damage to organs at higher dosages, for example. 

Sometimes, the drug molecule itself can be chemically reactive, and can cause damage. Keep using it and you get long term damage. Rarely, if such chemically reactive drug damage the DNA enough over the years, people can even get cancer. Fortunately, people know some of the common reactive features and avoid those.

To complicate things, the body tends to do things to a drug molecule to make it easier to get rid of it. That thing can be inherently toxic (such as one of paracetamol/panadol’s metabolite), or it can have effects of its own.

There are a lot of ways for a drug to cause long term problems and side effects. However, does this mean mRNA vaccines can do so too? There are differences between mRNA and drug molecules and that makes things different.

Ultimately, mRNA is a naturally occuring information carrying molecule. You have it in your body and it comes in many different lengths. The mRNA in the vaccine is not going to be any more reactive than those you already have!

Compared to drug molecules, mRNA are huge. Things bind to sites on the mRNA, not really the other way around. It’s not very likely to trigger things you wouldn’t expect a normal mRNA to trigger.

Inherently, mRNA are not toxic, so that is one safe part.

Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the viral product it encode for can target unwanted processes and cause effects, it isn’t something very likely. Given that mRNA is not very stable, it doesn’t stay for long and you are only exposed to the amounts injected. Even if the product is not harmless, it is transient and shouldn’t cause too much of an effect, and unlikely to cause a long-term one. Your body can take a bit of damage. You go out under the sun? Damage. Eat or touch stuff too hot? Damage. Etc etc.

It would be *far worse* to get the real deal, since the actual virus can replicate and make much much more potentially harmful viral proteins that a mRNA vaccine can cause your body to produce, on top of other problems associated with the actual covid virus.

To be honest, the most likely reactions are immune related ones and those most side effects are short term and not likely to be very harmful.

If you react very negatively to the mRNA in the vaccine and the protein it produces, I don’t think you would fare any better with the real virus.

The chances of the vaccine working as intended safely is high, probably better odds with that then the odds between mild and serious covid.",24/12/20,1.0,reddit

It talks about the RNA world, which is about evolution of life before DNA existed, hypothetically many billions of years ago. An RNA world must no doubt contain specialised proteins/RNA-based molecules to copy and make more of the RNA, make proteins out of it, etc. However, those genes and their associated proteins/special RNA molecules would have long been gone, since it no longer has a use in the DNA world.

Without the machinery to do so, your body cannot turn mRNA in the vaccine to viable hereditary information carrying molecules. And the vaccine *will not* contain any instruction to do so either.

>	The cells of the RNA world would presumably have been much less complex and less efficient in reproducing themselves than even the simplest present-day cells, since catalysis by RNA molecules is less efficient than that by proteins. They would have consisted of little more than a simple membrane enclosing a set of self-replicating molecules and a few other components required to provide the materials and energy for their replication.

DNA and RNA can only direct the cell machinery to do what the information on it tells them to.

Furthermore, you aren’t putting that information into the mRNA vaccine. *No one placed the sequence of nucleotides for an ancient RNA lifeform into a vaccine.* It’s not even a full viral genome in it!

No one placed the code for this completely hypothetical RNA baby into the vaccine. No one placed the code to give the body the ability to turn DNA into RNA.

Furthermore, RNA is inherently less stable than DNA, even in a similar double-helix form. It is fragile in single-stranded form. While possible to carry information in some RNA double-helix, its fragility meant that it requires upkeep and maintenance to repair it, just like DNA. *Unlike DNA*, you don’t have those specialised RNA repairing molecules lying around, because the vaccine doesn’t contain it and we don’t have it in our body because we don’t need it.

Regardless of whether it is even possible, there is no way that your far-fetched concerns would ever materialise. How is it even possible to get an RNA baby? Simple logic and biology knowledge would have precluded such possibilities. You can’t create something out of *nothing*.",24/12/20,1.0,reddit

Healthcare workers may perceive themselves to be guinea pigs, rather than beneficiaries, of this novel and untested mRNA technology.

It ultimately boils down to personal choice and agency. After all, no one likes to be told what to do. People may feel more comfortable with inoculation if they have a say on when they get vaccinated and which vaccine they take.

Many things are also moving in parallel instead of one after another.

A valid concern are the long term side effects, which is impossible to know because all the vaccines have just been developed. And there is no way around this besides continued studies & observations.

However weighing the pros and cons, the long term effects of the virus are also unknown, and there are many reports of long Covid.

If both are also unknown, I would think the potential side effects are less serious (looking at the \~30m people who have gotten the vaccine, obviously it's short-term details we can get for now) than actually catching the virus.

Other type of vaccines has small pool of data hence they took longer.

Because of the nano lipid particle used to encase the mrna itself, it is theorised that the vaccine may potentially be able to cross the blood brain barrier and enter into immunologically privileged sites. Where does the vaccine go? 

Not much study on that for now. 

And currently Pfizers phase 3 data was collected over a period of 2 months. Safety and efficacy cannot be established beyond that period of time but we generally assume it to be safe. 

If future doses are required to maintain immunity, will compounded doses result in a different safety profile? 

There is a reason why hcws may want to shy away from the mrna vaccine for now because they actually read medical journals and not pro vaccine messages from the mass media. 

Attenuated virus vaccines have been well studied. And we do know that the attenuated virus retains the trophism of the target virus (in this case, sars cov2).

The first burden is to understand how does vaccines work and how long they take to work. This portion is where I feel a lot of you 'wait and see' people don't really get. Vaccines (even mRna) work by activating your body's immunity to fight against the virus. 3 outcomes can happen. 1 is that your immunity don't get activated, 2 is that the vaccine activates your immunity and it kills the virus, 3 is that the vaccine activates but starts attacking the everything including your vital organs - that is what we call an autoimmune disease. - the process and the timeline for this 3 scenario to happen is pretty short. You don't need to wait for a long time for this 3 scenarios to happen. Plus the Pfizer clinical trial has been past 3 months.
Where it gets tricky for the layman is that they confuse medication that causes long term effects with vaccines. Even medicine that causes long term effects don't cause long term effects with 1-2 dose. It causes damage with long term use.

The 2nd burden is to properly educate the public within these 3 months regarding the vaccines. That is the proper channel to go through. People with no understanding of how vaccine/medicine works should not comment and provide advice on how people should feel about them.

What happens if they do get infected with the virus after rejecting the vaccine. Who now has to bear those costs? Probably the government will still bear it. But is it fair since it was them who rejected the vaccine. 

And once it's determined to be safe, should we then allow the healthcare personnel to cut the queue since they are in the high risk sector? Or should we enforce a strict queueing system to put them at the end. If we allow them to cut the queue, is this then fair to those who wants the vaccine but now have to wait longer? What if someone among this group gets the virus because of the delay? What if as a result of being put at the back of the queue, the healthcare personnel gets infected? then whose fault will it be.

"HAHA gosh you are trying really hard to twist my words.

>You yourself have said it’s about risk assessment. A doctor can give their risk assessment of whether a vaccine should be taken based on their informed opinions. What you’re really asking for is that all doctors should push the vaccination, which then means there is no proper risk assessment done.

I am not a doctor yet but I'll give you an example of doing an unbiased risk assessment without giving my opinions. At the end of this test you will find that ultimately I have not influenced you in anyway.

With regards to the Pfizer Vaccine, it is a new technology. Unlike previous vaccines where they introduce a inactivated virus into your body which would activate your immunity system to fight against this Covid virus. Instead of inject a virus, they inject a protein into your body. It is supposedly safer because you are not injecting a virus into your body. There is a fear (not a risk) that this protein may cause some autoimmune issues, this is an opinion of some people there is no data of this happening. The technology has been studied for decades but they have not pushed this to the markets. The reason is that this technology is an expensive solution to the traditional solution (they ultimately do the same thing) but from a market perspective it is largely unproven. Whether it is safe or not, nobody has enough data to conclusively tell you whether it is safe to take or not. You have to decide on your own. Known side effects for the vaccines are also common there may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days.

Ultimately, you should decide to take an unproven vaccine vs trying to return to a time where there is no fear of getting Covid.",13/1/21,1.0,reddit

> SINGAPORE - Singapore received its first shipment of China's Sinovac vaccine on Tuesday (Feb 23). However, the product has not yet been authorised for use by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), said the Health Ministry on Wednesday (Feb 24).

> In a statement, the ministry said: ""Sinovac has started submitting initial data, and HSA is currently awaiting Sinovac's submission of all the necessary information in order to carry out a thorough scientific assessment of the manufacturing process, safety and efficacy of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route.""

> Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently being used in Singapore, have received interim authorisation under this route. Both vaccines involve injecting snippets of the virus' genetic material into the body to stimulate an immune response.

> In contrast, Sinovac's product is an inactivated vaccine, which makes use of killed virus particles. This method has been used in vaccines for diseases such as polio.

> MOH also said it received a fresh shipment of the Pfizer vaccine on Wednesday, and will continue to monitor vaccine supplies closely.

> In a Facebook post, the Chinese embassy said the delivery of the vaccine cements the agreement made by both countries to cooperate on issues related to the pandemic.

> ""China and Singapore have helped each other to meet the challenge since the Covid-19 epidemic broke out, setting a fine example for cooperation against the virus among countries,"" it wrote.

> It added that China will continue to work with Singapore to ""enhance cooperation on vaccine and epidemic control, build a global community of health for all, and win the final victory in the fight against the epidemic"".

""At Tuesday’s press conference, Palácios said Sinovac’s relatively low efficacy rate of 50% was due to its more rigorous standard for what counts as an infection among trial volunteers. The Butantan Institute said it included six types of cases in its results: asymptomatic, very mild, mild, two levels of moderate, and severe. (The Brazilian authorities stressed that the public should focus on the vaccine’s 100% efficacy in protecting against severe cases of COVID-19.) Western vaccine makers generally included only mild, moderate, and severe categories, and companies like Pfizer are doing additional studies to see if the vaccine will prevent asymptomatic cases.""

People want to compare other studies, but that’s like comparing a person that runs a 1-kilometer race on a flat stretch and another doing it on a steep and obstacle-filled stretch,” Palácios said.

"" There is some evidence to back up Palácios’ claim that Brazil’s trial standards are more likely to catch mild cases of COVID-19 than trials conducted elsewhere, which would result in a lower efficacy rate."" In the U.S.’s Food and Drug Administration’s evaluation of Pfizer’s vaccine trials, the agency found that there were up to 1,594 suspected but unconfirmed cases of COVID-19. Because the infections were unconfirmed, they didn’t factor into the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy rate.

“It’s true that other vaccine trials have not been able to confirm as many mild infections [as Sinovac],” says Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong. “The [vaccine efficacy] against mild disease could be lower than 90%-95% for Moderna and Pfizer.”

"Hi,
 
  I'm just trying to correct the record, hope this gets enough visibility. Happy to answer more questions if necessary. 

> We already know now that antibody immunity to a natural infection fades fast. 

  I am not sure what you mean by that, but I assume that you are referring to the studies that demonstrated that the antibody levels in recovered patients decrease after a few months. Thing is, the adaptive immune system (i.e. T and B cells) have memory. That means that once the adaptive immune system sees an pathogen or infection, they are likely to have a secondary response that is much faster than the original defense.

Hence, loss of detectable antibody in the blood/plasma doesn't mean that the memory B cells or plasmablasts are gone, nor does it mean that the patients that we can't find the antibody in can be reinfected by the virus (i.e. immunity may still be there) Truth is, we'll only know when it's put to the test.

> What the Singapore work shows is that the earlier SARS outbreak established very long-lasting immunity against SARS that also covers SARS-2. That also included CD8+ T-cells that play a key role in killing infected cells. As SARS-2 as similar to SARS, there is reasonable hope that these other new vaccines could also elicit long-term immunity. However, they did not study the S protein that those other vaccines are based on so we don't actually know if long-term T-cell immunity can be generated against that. It will be a ""game over"" downer for all candidates if it can't. Couldn't at least one effort have selected the NP protein instead? Groupthink.

The fact that the NP protein responses are being generated at a much higher frequency in COVID patients just means that for some reason, the SARS-COV-2 virus' most immunogenic protein is there. Why that is the case may have nothing to do with the antibody and the quality of the immune defense against the virus.

The S protein was chosen based on previous studies of similar viruses such as SARS and MERS. In fact, the main reason why we have clinical trials that quickly already is that much of the early work for developing a vaccine based off this target was already done. Based off this new study, we may need to look into NP. But a S protein based target may still work, since it doesn't [mutate as frequently] (https://translational-medicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12967-020-02392-y), and still can [generate a response] (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483?query=featured_home). 

The main reason I am replying is to hope that you and others don't judge the work of the researchers based on hindsight. After all, hindsight is 20/20 for a reason.",18/7/20,1.0,reddit
This is really interesting. I wonder what % of our population already has the wuhan-specific T-cell immunity due to previous infections from unknown coronaviruses. Is it possible to test for the presence of these T-cells?,18/7/20,0.0,reddit
"The boldest part is important, so I feel that you are writing off the inactivated vaccines way too quickly. Inactivated vaccines will have all the proteins present in the virus particle, including the NP that you wanted, leading to a broad T cell response.

Inactivated vaccines are injected into muscle, contain a high dose of viral antigens all at once, don’t unleash various immune-suppressive tactics, may contain adjuvant etc. All in all, very different from natural infection in the respiratory tract. Most importantly, the inactivated vaccines consist of more than one shot (at least one booster shot will be give). While the response after the first shot may be kind of weak/transient, the booster shot should induce a much stronger secondary response.",18/7/20,1.0,reddit

Even without a vaccine, I'm hoping that treatment protocols can improve such that we get the death rate down to a flu-like %, such that life can resume as before... E.g.

"This T-cell study (by Duke-NUS team again) is remarkable if the data holds out in subsequent investigations. Because it strongly suggests about 50% of us may have pre-exposure to animal betacoronaviruses, and this can generate cross protective T-cell immunity to CoV-2.

The implications of that are pretty wild. For one, we may have a much higher diversity of coronaviruses which spillover from the animal reservoir (esp in SE Asia with the high biodiversity), and which goes under the radar because they cause no symptoms or very mild symptoms. 

Secondly, this may explain the perplexing differences in mortality in for example SG, Vietnam, even South China, compared to Lombardy or the US. Some regional populations may have pre-existing immunity from prior ""angel"" spillovers.

"I'm no biomedical graduate, but I have serious doubts that we, as a species, could develop an effective vaccine against SARS2.

We have never develop a vaccine for a coronavirus. Ever. I believe the reason cited was that coronaviruses are highly seasonal and die off before any R&D into them can take flight. So without this experience, I have my doubts that we will have a proper vaccine for SARS2 before SARS3 comes out.",18/7/20,1.0,reddit

Showing a T-cell response does not mean that you are immune to the coronavirus and cannot be infectious.

"Inactivated vaccines, in general, don't generate cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses well and that's what you need to kill virus infected cells.  The problem is CTLs are MHC class I-restricted so the antigen to generate them must be derived intracellularly, for example, with an attenuated virus vaccine or such-like.  Inactivated vaccines provide extracellular antigen and those are processed via MHC class II - that pathway does not generate CTLs.

In principle, if you fiddled around with the inactivation just right so the inactivated virus particle is still capable of fusing with the target cell so antigen can get presented via MHC class I, you could potentially get some CTL response but is not the usual outcome.",20/7/20,0.0,reddit
"There was never a strong incentive to develop vaccines against “common cold” coronaviruses, given their mildness (still can kill babies and elderly though) and the fact that they only account for ~20% of colds anyway.

SARS vaccine research actually got quite far (Phase I human trials completed, good results in monkeys) but the virus died out and there was no reason/funding to go further.

I complete agree with you. Moreover, we are 100 percent urbanized and only 720 sq km, which should make it easy to transport the vaccines to anywhere on the island.

The only explanation I can think of for the plans for vaccination centers is that they originally planned for vaccinations to be done in hospitals and polyclinics for storage reasons (e.g. ultralow refrigeration) before realizing that the vaccines are more easily transportable with dry ice which means that the injections can be done outside of polyclinics and hospitals.

* Work in an industry with rostered testing? Logically, can reduce testing frequency if vaccinated. So, not being vaccinated means you may need to pay for your own test every 7/14 days or work OT by getting tests on your own time. Otherwise not fair to vaccinated colleagues right?

* Want to work in a public facing role? Employers probably will ask at interview. 

* Nightlife or concerts...venue capacity can be increased if organizers ask for vaccine declarations.

"Spore should look into the efficiency of public service so that people can take bus or MRT  to work. But my area has the worst public transport in Spore, it is at Petir Road, I used to wait for bus no. 973 for 11 to 14 mins during peak hour to go home.

Singapore - because of smart policies and high discipline ! - has the luxury that we don’t have the Virus here and that people don’t die ! Therefore in Singapore it is possible that front line workers like in aviation and maritime can get vaccinated first! That is a hard earned privilege for the whole country to focus now on economic recovery! Most other (often Western) countries don’t have this choice ! Well done Singapore ! 🇸🇬,2021-01-20,1.0,instagram

"SINGAPORE - Singapore's vaccination drive has been brought forward for all seniors, and will also be extended to more high risk groups and essential workers including teachers, postmen and migrant workers. This is possible because more supplies of the vaccine have arrived, said the Health Ministry (MOH) of Monday (March 8). As or March 7, more than 596,000 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered. In total, about 379,000 individuals in Singapore have received at least the first dose; of whom more than 217,000 have received their second dose, MOH said. The Ministry had earlier announced that seniors aged 60 to 69 would get their first dose around the end of March. However, it said on Monday that all seniors in this age group will now get their invitation letters within the next few days. Each letter will have a weblink which can be used to register for vaccination, after which an SMS with a unique booking link will be sent to the senior's mobile phone for them to book a vaccination appointment. Seniors can also book their appointments for vaccination at any community centre or community club. So far, over 55,000 seniors aged 70 and up have received their first dose of the vaccine, while another 96,000 seniors have made appointments to receive their first dose in the next few weeks. MOH also said that the vaccine programme will continue to be extended to other higher risk groups, as well as essential frontline workers of critical importance to Singapore, including those who could pose risks to vulnerable populations and the community at large if they are infected.",3/8/21,1.0,hardwarezone

The Ministry had earlier announced that seniors aged 60 to 69 would get their first dose around the end of March. However, it said on Monday that all seniors in this age group will now get their invitation letters within the next few days. Each letter will have a weblink which can be used to register for vaccination, after which an SMS with a unique booking link will be sent to the senior's mobile phone for them to book a vaccination appointment. Seniors can also book their appointments for vaccination at any community centre or community club. So far, over 55,000 seniors aged 70 and up have received their first dose of the vaccine, while another 96,000 seniors have made appointments to receive their first dose in the next few weeks.

Hong Kong was on Saturday facing fewer than 10 coronavirus cases, according to another source. On a morning radio show, Secretary for Food and Health Sophia Chan Shiu-chee had sought to allay concerns over the first death, following a drop in daily bookings for the city\x92s inoculation drive. Chan noted the reduction in vaccination appointments after the February 28 death of a Sinovac recipient, saying it was understandable that residents would like to think thoroughly about the decision or consult their doctors. The expert panel had determined the death of the chronically ill man, 63, who had received the jab at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, was not directly linked to the mainland-produced vaccine. The source said the other person who died \x96 a 55-year-old woman with multiple chronic illnesses \x96 received the vaccination on March 2 at the same centre and felt unwell on March 5, exhibiting stroke-like symptoms.

"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/...th-chronically Hong Kong health authorities on Tuesday night revealed that they were investigating the death of a chronically ill man two days after he received China\x92s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine, but cautioned that no connection had been ascertained yet. The Department of Health said the 63-year-old man had received the shot on February 26 at Kwun Chung Sports Centre in Jordan, one of the government\x92s designated vaccination sites. He was sent to Queen Elizabeth Hospital on February 28 after suffering shortness of breath. A source said the man had suffered a cardiac arrest soon after he was admitted, and died on the same day after failed resuscitation attempts. \x93At the moment, the causal relationship with the vaccination cannot be ascertained,\x94 the department said in a late-night statement, adding that it was seeking more information from the Hospital Authority. The source said that when the man was admitted to hospital, clinicians were notified that he had been vaccinated with the Sinovac jab, but at that time they thought the conditions were unrelated, as the patient suffered from chronic illnesses. The department, meanwhile, said it would also pass the case details to a new expert committee for assessing clinical events to establish the causal links and publish a report in due course. A hospital spokesman said the man, who also had a record of respiratory tract diseases, was admitted at about 1.30am on Sunday. He was transferred to a medical ward at about 3am but his condition deteriorated rapidly and he died at around 6am. The Coroner\x92s Court would follow up on the death, the spokesman said. In a press briefing at about 12.30am on Wednesday, hospital deputy chief executive Dr Johnny Chan Wai-man said the patient told emergency unit staff he had received a jab, but personnel in the medical ward were not aware of the vaccination as they focused on his rapidly deteriorating condition. Chan said no signs of allergic reactions were detected during resuscitation attempts and staff believed from clinical judgments the patient had chronic bronchitis, for which he was treated. None of the patient\x92s conditions that day could be associated with inoculation, he said. The hospital alerted the health department the following day after reviewing his record and realising he had been vaccinated. Dr Ronald Lam Man-kin, controller of the Centre for Health Protection, stressed that it was too early to conclude there was a causal relationship and the expert committee would examine the incident. The vaccine was still recommended as the benefits outweighed the risks, he said, adding that the department\x92s monitoring mechanism was in line with international standards. \x93A vaccination programme cannot be arbitrarily stopped before a causal relationship is established,\x94 Lam said. Chan, however, admitted that communications could be improved. Professor David Hui Shu-cheong, a respiratory medicine expert at Chinese University and a government adviser on the pandemic, said whether the man\x92s death was related to the vaccination had yet to be concluded by a postmortem examination. He said the man had suffered from four risk factors of a coronary artery disease, including his smoking habit, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia and high blood glucose levels, which could pose threats to his health even without the vaccine. The diabetic man had been seeking treatment from a government outpatient clinic and was taking two kinds of medicine. His blood glucose levels were normal when he was admitted to the hospital emergency unit. \x93If the [diabetes] is well controlled, there is no problem in getting the vaccine,\x94 Hui said. Experts had said adverse reactions reported by several people after receiving shots of the mainland-made Sinovac vaccine were unlikely to be linked to the jab. Some 40,000 people have received the jab so far. Meanwhile, bookings for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was jointly developed by German and US firms, will open on Wednesday at 9am. With 140,000 slots available for priority residents, the jabs will be offered from March 10 to 30 at seven vaccination centres operated by the Hospital Authority. With another vaccine option available, Hui said earlier, one of the factors in choosing which jab to go for would be the recipient\x92s travel habits. He said people who needed to travel overseas frequently could benefit from the potentially greater protection offered by the BioNTech vaccine. Sinovac shots, he added, would be adequate for those who usually stayed in Hong Kong or only travelled to the mainland, where mutated strains of the virus were not yet prevalent. \x93The BioNTech vaccine could neutralise the mutated strains that emerged in Britain and South Africa,\x94 Hui said. \x93The coverage of protection could be wider.\x94 At least seven people had been sent to hospital after they developed complications \x96 such as a rapid heartbeat, dizziness and high blood pressure \x96 following Sinovac shots over the past few days. The University of Hong Kong\x92s Professor Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, co-convenor of the expert committee on adverse reactions to vaccines, said the conditions reported by the patients were also common in other situations. \x93Dizziness is a common response among some people who get injected for vaccinations or blood-drawing. Many people also have palpitations,\x94 he said, referring to the condition of a fast-beating or fluttering heart. He said the committee would meet on Wednesday to look into the adverse events. Hui also said those reactions were likely to have been caused by unconscious responses in the nervous system, such as rising heart rates due to a fear of needles or blood. \x93If you are afraid of needles, maybe don\x92t look at the needle,\x94 he told a radio programme. \x93There\x92s no need to worry, the needle is there to help you develop immunity.\x94 For the administration of the BioNTech shots, which must be kept long-term at minus 70 degrees Celsius and thawed and diluted before injection, each inoculation centre will be equipped with two pharmaceutical fridges to store the vials at temperatures between 2 and 8 degrees for no more than five days. To prevent spoilage, the jabs would be prepared in batches throughout the day, depending on the booking demand, said Angela Liu Hor-ki from the Hospital Authority\x92s Hong Kong East cluster, which manages the vaccination centre at Sai Wan Ho Sports Centre. \x93We will prepare the vaccines according to the bookings, we won\x92t [dilute] the vaccines all in one go,\x94 she said. Each vial contains five doses, and the shot in each syringe can be kept at room temperature no higher than 30 degrees and must be administered within six hours. With four to six pharmacists allocated at each vaccination centre, a maximum of 200 syringes could be prepared per hour, Liu added. Dr Luk Che-chung, chief executive of the authority\x92s Hong Kong East cluster, said health workers were confident about delivering a smooth vaccination programme even though many technical issues were involved in handling the BioNTech jabs.",3/3/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"SINGAPORE - Singapore has launched a campaign to raise awareness of the national vaccination programme, as part of its push to get residents inoculated against Covid-19. The VacciNationSG campaign will also address misconceptions and debunk misinformation, said Minister for Communications and Information S. Iswaran on Tuesday (March 2). ""The first line of defence in our fight against misinformation is a well-informed citizenry who receive accurate communications, from reliable sources, in a timely manner,"" Mr Iswaran noted during the debate on his ministry's budget. Several MPs, including Mr Sitoh Yih Pin (Potong Pasir) and Mr Liang Eng Hwa (Bukit Panjang), had observed that the Government's communications strategy has had to change in tandem with evolving needs. ""There is a need to ensure that all Singaporeans receive timely and accurate information that is relatable and capable of being understood by everyone with diverse needs,"" Mr Sitoh noted. He asked how the Government considers factors such as age groups and literacy levels when tapping digital means of communication, and stressed that all communication channels - digital or otherwise - should remain two-way in order to garner ground feedback. Responding, Mr Iswaran said the Government's ""foremost communications challenge"" in tackling the virus has been to ensure Singaporeans of all stripes can access trustworthy information. By leveraging both traditional and digital platforms - including Telegram, Instagram and TikTok - it was able to broaden and deepen the reach of official communications, he said. The Gov.sg portal is now available on 10 platforms, with its WhatsApp channel growing from 7,000 subscribers in January last year to 1.2 million subscribers today. At the same time, the People's Association and Silver Generation Office carried out face-to-face outreach programmes for those who were not on social media. ""This was to ensure that all segments of our population were informed of key developments of the pandemic, why certain measures were necessary and how they could play their part to protect the health and safety of all Singaporeans,"" Mr Iswaran said. He added that polls conducted by government feedback unit Reach indicated that more than eight in 10 people felt the Government provided enough information on Covid-19. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...vaccine-combat",3/3/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"china hawk speaks https://www.facebook.com/bilahari.ka...66118706978872 Bilahari Kausikan Let me draw a parallel which while imperfect, may nevertheless explain things. Since Deng Xiaoping, every Chinese administration has asked the Singapore government to do a project in China, the latest is the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative which is part of Xi Jinping\u2019s signature BRI. It has been some time since China has had anything significant to learn from Singapore\u2019s experience. But one \u2014 certainly not the sole \u2014 reason why these projects are useful to Beijing is that the Singapore government is what could be called a \u2018reference investor\u2019 and its participation is the \u2018good house-keeping seal of approval\u2019, assuring others of the integrity of the project. China has not released any data about the Sinovac vaccine. Data from Brazil and Turkey show wildly differing levels of efficacy. Hence doubts abound, although desperate countries will accept and use it. Singapore has Covid-19 under control and is not desperate. We are known for thoroughness and integrity. If we approve the vaccine, it will do much to calm the doubts of others. But HSA will certainly not approve Sinovac until it is sure that it poses no greater risks than the other already approved vaccines. It is ridiculous to suggest that the health of Singaporeans will be given hostage to diplomacy. If that was indeed China\u2019s intent, than it is yet another example of how Beijing misunderstands Singapore.",28/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

Beijing sent its coronavirus vaccine to the city state before Singapore\u2019s health authorities approved the jab Some health experts questioned China\u2019s intent behind the move, suggesting that it might be \u2018unhappy\u2019 if Singapore is slow in approving the vaccine When the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccines arrived in Singapore in December, the moment was cheered by residents and politicians alike. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung received the shipment with much fanfare and oversaw its delivery to a cold-chain warehouse, while Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong called the arrival of the vaccines a \u201cwelcome present that we\u2019ve all been looking forward to\u201d. It was a similar story two months later, when the city state received its first batch of Moderna shots. Lee said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the delivery, and reporters were forwarded a series of photographs showing the bulky vaccine boxes with a Singapore Airlines plane in the background. Yet there was no such fanfare to greet the arrival of the China-made Sinovac shots on Tuesday evening. Rather, the seemingly played-down event was only made known a day later by the Chinese embassy. Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Health later confirmed that the Sinovac jabs had arrived but stressed that the vaccine has not yet been authorised by regulators and so cannot be used immediately, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna shots. Analysts said the uncertainty surrounding the Sinovac jabs likely contributed to the stark contrast in reactions, while suggesting that there could be unstated diplomatic pressure on Singapore to approve the vaccine. Leong Hoe Nam, an infectious diseases expert, noted it was \u201cunusual\u201d that the vaccines had arrived before authorisation was granted. A vaccine shipment that arrives before authorisation could face a host of challenges, he said, including the risk the vaccines could expire before they are officially approved, although reports said the Sinovac vaccine has a refrigerated shelf life of three years. He questioned why China had sent the jabs, remarking that \u201cIt\u2018s almost like they are begging Singapore to use\u201d them. Singapore had hammered out an advance agreement with Sinovac on the vaccine, although no details about the scheduled delivery date were revealed. Khor Swee Kheng, a Malaysian specialist in health policies, said countries that receive vaccines before regulatory approval face concerns about the possibility of \u201cregulatory limbo\u201d and the risk of political pressure on regulatory authorities to approve the vaccine shipments. He said that countries around the world are struggling to balance the speed of regulatory approvals and expiring agreements with pharmaceutical firms, and suggested that if regulatory approval is too slow in one country, then another country that has already approved a particular vaccine could exercise its \u201ccontractual right\u201d and purchase the vaccines from the former. Singapore\u2018s Ministry of Health said Wednesday that Sinovac has started submitting initial data on the efficacy of the vaccine to the ministry\u2019s Health Sciences Authority. But Leong said there was no time frame for the process, and likened the approval of a vaccine without the needed data to back it up to endorsing the fiscal health of a company with no financial statements. \u201cOnly when all factors are met will the approval go through,\u201d Leong said. Chong Ja Ian, a political scientist and scholar of Chinese foreign policy at the National University of Singapore, said Beijing was eager to see the international adoption of its vaccines as part of its so-called vaccine diplomacy. He said the Tuesday shipment to the city state was part of the campaign. Chong said there was a chance that Beijing could be \u201cunhappy\u201d if Singapore does not \u2013 or is slow \u2013 in approving the Sinovac vaccine, given its eagerness to showcase its capabilities. \u201cHowever, the core consideration during this time of crisis should be [the vaccine\u2019s] safety and effectiveness \u2026 rather than whether particular governments or leaders are happy or not,\u201d he added. \u201cAny focus other than public health at this moment of crisis is irresponsible.\u201d The Chinese embassy in Singapore lauded the vaccine shipment as having added a \u201cnew highlight\u201d to the 30 years of Sino-Singapore ties. It wrote on Facebook that it believed the vaccine would contribute to Singapore\u2019s virus efforts, and that Beijing would continue to work with the city state to \u201cwin the final victory\u201d against the pandemic. Given Singapore\u2019s reputation for standards, Chong said, its authorisation of the Sinovac vaccine would be seen as a seal of approval for all China-developed vaccines. Victor Shih, an associate professor of political economy at the University of California San Diego, concurred that Singapore\u2019s approval would lend credence to the idea that Chinese vaccines are globally accepted, noting that these vaccines have mostly been used in developing countries, including Indonesia and the Philippines. Singapore is among the few wealthy countries that are considering the use or Chinese vaccines, alongside the United Arab Emirates. Shih said, however, that the main audience for Beijing\u2019s vaccine diplomacy was a domestic one. \u201cWhen China rolls out a mass vaccination campaign domestically, the government wants Chinese citizens to accept the Chinese vaccines, despite their lower efficacy compared to leading Western vaccines,\u201d he said. Trial data shows Sinovac having an efficacy rate of about 50.4 per cent, compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine\u2019s 95 per cent and Moderna\u2019s 94 per cent efficacy rates. Shih said that there could be \u201csome pressure applied behind the scenes\u201d for Singapore to approve the Sinovac jab, but added that even if it is approved there would likely be \u201cfew users\u201d in the city state given the supplies of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. The Singapore government has not disclosed how many doses of each vaccine it has, and said residents would not get to choose the shots they receive. Authorities said about 250,000 residents had received their first jabs as of last Thursday, and that over 110,000 had been inoculated twice, with vaccinations of elderly residents well under way. Meanwhile, Zha Daojiong, a professor at Peking University\u2019s School of International Studies, stressed that the decision made by the Singapore health regulatory authority on approving the Sinovac vaccine would be one based on scientific rigour \u201crather than diplomatic or political goodwill\u201d. He noted that the Sinovac vaccine has been through rounds of scientific and policy tests in different countries, and that talk of China pushing hard for a country to adopt its vaccine was \u201cdifficult to substantiate\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t see an impact \u2026 in any political and diplomatic sense that comes with an eventual decision by Singapore,\u201d Zha said. \u201cIt would be very unwise for China\u2019s agencies of diplomacy to appear [to be] pressuring any government to make a positive decision about Chinese vaccines and for any government to make a decision on political goodwill.\u201d",28/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

First the gov make it optional, so if there's any very bad adverse events, the gov scared to be blamed. Secondly, they use fearmongering that you may face discrimination or rice bowl taken away from you if don't take. This is downright blackmailing you to take. It's like say, "" You better go take ah, if not I take away your ricebowl. Oh if you take but something bad happen, don't say I force you to take okay? "" - Totally irresponsible. Not to forget, they won't be responsible for long term side-effects and treatment. They'll only pay your hospitalisation bill. So the gov totally ignoring those who cannot take due to history of allergies or have pre-existing condition which they have no data whether it'll affect them in long term. In the US, you can't sue Pfizer or Moderna even if you have severe vaccine side effects. They already have legal immunity from liability.

It was a similar story two months later, when the city state received its first batch of Moderna shots. Lee said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the delivery, and reporters were forwarded a series of photographs showing the bulky vaccine boxes with a Singapore Airlines plane in the background.

His swab taken on 3 January during SHN was negative for COVID-19.* He is asymptomatic, and was detected when he was tested on 21 February as part of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT). His pooled test result came back positive for COVID-19 the next day. An individual test was done on 23 February, and he was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 24 February. He was subsequently conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. His earlier tests from RRT \x96 the last being on 13 February \x96 were negative for COVID-19 infection. His serology test result has come back positive but we have assessed that this is likely a current infection. Case 60448 received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 22 January, and the second dose on 14 February. This accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. However as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination, he was likely to have been infected before he was conferred protection after vaccination.* https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...ction-25-02-21 https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/e...6472622-2.html",26/2/21,0.0,hardwarezone

Playing on words to spin different narratives on what you actually mean when caught lying? Well, I am glad you posted this for all to see what a liar you are. Lolol. Errr... why so serious?  Yet again u come back with a usual strange response  when the fact is I had reminded that one of your source has clearly stated the Chinese vaccine has arrived on our shores. And what do we get in return? Lots of name callings, denials and even saying ""misinterpreting"" the article. U even claim ""sinovac has not arrived in SG yet.""..that's your own words hor.

Me too - My driving consideration are - unlike the 1st-time-on-human mRNA method (e.g. vaccine from Pfizer-BioNtech), the Chinese uses a more proven traditional approach by developing vaccines based on inactivated (aka ""dead"") coronavirus. This is like taking advantage of existing natural-origin dead virus to generate immunity...IMO, this is safer way considering all COVID-19 vaccines are created without long-term testing under current global emergency. The Chinese vaccine has been tested more extensively on Asian subjects while being co-manufactured with other countries. This is a key reason why Indonesia, Brazil, Serbia, Turkey are able to get the Chinese vaccine quicker vs how the EU and US are stuggling to meet the demand, resulting in hoarding by these countries (that's another topic to discuss) Chinese vaccine is more effordable, require common freezer-temp to store and last longer in storage Sinovac vaccine package - Note the ""Inactivated"" coronavirus label.",24/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

On top of that only Recently china approved sinovac as non emergency rollout no? People trust data here, it\x92s a fact that Singapore has stringent approvals for vaccine and it is telling why sinovac not approved yet, so no need to peddle for something that you cannot take today. Recently the inactivated virus narrative is falling apart because most of the known world (developed countries) use pfizer instead, pleae don\x92t say Brazil indonesia. Key reason those countries want sinovac is because 1) cannot afford more expensive vaccines 2) cannot outmuscle other countries. Please don\x92t say untill they are the wise ones. China also struggling with production concerns. And again how does Brazil, indo. Serbia using it affect your decision? You take the vaccines from those countries?

But the fact that they picked Sinovac and worse ... invested in Arcturus Therapeutics ( their vaccine tanked) showed that they are incompetent by any reasonable benchmark.

"The Johor state government hopes that Malaysia's Covid-19 Immunisation Programme will help drive efforts to reopen cross-border travel between Malaysia and Singapore. Johor Menteri Besar Hasni Mohammad said that the reopening of the border was vital in spurring the state's economy. ""Once people from both countries have been vaccinated, the movement between our two countries will be easier and safe, "" he said. The border with Singapore has been closed since the movement control order was first implemented in March 18 last year. Currently, only commercial vehicles ferrying goods cross the land border daily. Datuk Hasni added that the state government was ready to carry out the immunisation programme at designated vaccination centres in each district statewide. He added that for a start, he and his state executive councillors would be among the first to take the vaccine when the programme starts in Johor. Malaysia received its first batch of more than 300,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines on Sunday with another batch of 182,520 doses expected to arrive on Wednesday (Feb 24), according to Bernama news agency. Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Khairy Jamaluddin, who is also tasked with leading the national Covid-19 immunisation programme, said the vaccination roll-out would be brought forward to Wednesday from Friday. Malaysia recorded 2,192 more Covid-19 infections on Monday, bringing total cases to 285,761, says the Health Ministry. Six more people died due to the coronavirus, pushing Malaysia's Covid-19 death toll to 1,062. As at Feb 21, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases in Johor stands at 33,382 with 91 deaths. https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se...g-efforts-with",23/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/artic...li-study-shows Quote: The Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE Covid-19 vaccine appeared to stop the vast majority of recipients in Israel becoming infected, providing the first real-world indication that the immunization will curb transmission of the coronavirus. The vaccine, which was rolled out in a national immunization program that began Dec. 20, was 89.4% effective at preventing laboratory-confirmed infections , according to a copy of a draft publication that was posted on Twitter and confirmed by a person familiar with the work. The companies and Israel\x92s Health Ministry worked together on the preliminary observational analysis, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. The results, also reported in Der Spiegel, are the latest in a series of positive data to emerge out of Israel, which has given more Covid vaccines per capita than anywhere else in the world. Nearly half of the population has had at least one dose of vaccine. Separately, Israeli authorities on Saturday said the Pfizer-BioNTech shot was 99% effective at preventing deaths from the virus. The early results on lab-confirmed infections are important because they show the vaccine may also prevent asymptomatic carriers from spreading the virus that causes Covid-19, something that hadn\x92t been clear so far. Stopping transmission in this way is a key factor as countries seek to lift contact restrictions and re-open economies. https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/20/h...day/index.html Quote: Health experts have said that data so far has shown that Covid-19 vaccines prevent symptoms of the virus -- but a new study suggests that the Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines may also prevent infections. A team at the Mayo Clinic health system looked at more than 31,000 people across four states who had received at least one dose of either vaccine -- and found the vaccines were upward of 80% effective in preventing infection 36 days after the first dose. Vaccine efficacy was 75% 15 days after the first dose , and it appeared to be 83% after a total of 36 days passed . But that number rose to nearly 89% when researchers examined only people who received two doses , according to the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. While the trials that Moderna and Pfizer used to win Food and Drug Administration authorization for their vaccines looked for symptomatic infection, the Mayo researchers said they looked for both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection.",21/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"Case of S'porean who had cardiac arrest after vaccination taken 'very seriously', criteria & processes will be refined: Gan Kim Yong This is ensure there are no adverse effects post-vaccination. Editor\x92s note, Feb. 19, 7:05pm: An earlier version of this article reported inaccurately that the 72-year-old man has died after vaccination. The man, who suffered a cardiac arrest two days after vaccination, is now in ICU. The article has been corrected. We sincerely apologise for the error and the stress that it may have caused our readers. A 72-year-old Singaporean man who received his first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Feb. 16 suffered a cardiac arrest on the same night. The man was vaccinated on Tuesday morning, Feb. 16, and was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) after suffering cardiac arrest on the same night, the Ministry of Health announced on Feb. 18. The man, who has a history of cancer, hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, had been assessed by trained healthcare personnel to be suitable for Covid-19 vaccination prior to vaccination. Continue monitoring vaccinated patients At a media doorstop on Feb. 19 at Jalan Besar Community Centre, Minister for Health and co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce Gan Kim Yong addressed concerns which might arise from this incident. Gan reiterated that initial assessments showed that man's cardiac arrest was unrelated to the vaccination. However, he assured that steps were being taken to continue monitoring and collecting data on vaccinated patients. This is ensure there are no adverse effects post-vaccination. ""We do want to know about it, so we can collect the data and refine our criteria for vaccinations,"" he said. Gan added that they would monitor data ""not only locally, but internationally"" as well, so that vaccinations remain safe for people. Gan also highlighted the precautions currently in place for patients \x97 every person who takes the vaccination will be required to go through several thorough questionnaires on their wellbeing and a 30-minute post-vaccination observation period. Advice is also given to those who might experience any reaction to the vaccine. Once again, Gan emphasised the severity of such incidents: ""I want to assure Singaporeans that we do take this very seriously, whether they're related to the vaccination or not, we want to know if there are any such incidents so that we can investigate in depth and better understand the situation. And our criteria and processes will continue to be refined to ensure it can remain safe for anyone who wants to be vaccinated."" Making vaccinations available for more people Vaccinations for seniors aged 70 and above in Singapore will start on Feb. 22. Gan added that invitations letters to those aged between 60 and 69 would be sent out by the middle of March. Following this, vaccination slots will be opened to more groups of people, and the general public might be able to get their shots ""probably some time after April"". https://mothership.sg/2021/02/monito...-gan-kim-yong/",19/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"LONDON (REUTERS) - Rich countries are on course to have over a billion more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, a report by anti-poverty campaigners found on Friday (Feb 19). In an analysis of current supply deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the ONE Campaign said wealthy countries, such as the United States and Britain, should share the excess doses to ""supercharge"" a fully global response to the pandemic. The advocacy group, which campaigns against poverty and preventable diseases, said a failure to do so would deny billions of people essential protection from the Covid-19-causing virus and likely prolong the pandemic. The report looked specifically at contracts with the five leading Covid-19 vaccine makers - Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax. It found that to date, the United States, the European Union, Britain, Australia, Canada and Japan have already secured more than 3 billion doses - over a billion more than the 2.06 billion needed to give their entire populations two doses. ""This huge excess is the embodiment of vaccine nationalism,"" said Jenny Ottenhoff, ONE Campaign's senior director for policy. ""Rich countries understandably hedged their bets on vaccines early in the pandemic but with these bets paying off in spades, a massive course correction is needed if we are going to protect billions of people around the world,"" she added. The analysis found that, along with other Covid-19 vaccine supplies procured by the global Covax vaccine-sharing plan and in bilateral deals, the excess rich-country doses would go a long way to protecting vulnerable people in poorer countries. This would significantly reduce the risk of deaths from Covid-19, it said, as well as limiting the chances of new virus variants emerging and accelerating an end to the pandemic. The World Health Organisation on Thursday urged nations with vaccines not to share them unilaterally, but to donate them to the global Covax scheme to ensure fairness. https://www.straitstimes.com/world/e...-needed-report",19/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"SimpliCity2k wrote: LONDON (REUTERS) - Rich countries are on course to have over a billion more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than they need, leaving poorer nations scrambling for leftover supplies as the world seeks to curb the coronavirus pandemic, a report by anti-poverty campaigners found on Friday (Feb 19). In an analysis of current supply deals for Covid-19 vaccines, the ONE Campaign said wealthy countries, such as the United States and Britain, should share the excess doses to ""supercharge"" a fully global response to the pandemic. The advocacy group, which campaigns against poverty and preventable diseases, said a failure to do so would deny billions of people essential protection from the Covid-19-causing virus and likely prolong the pandemic.

Not many people here actually realize they are taking a much bigger risk by choosing a vaccine that doesn't work. People that take ineffective vaccines will believe they are safe could just be a placebo and engage in more risky behavior by having fun. They can be barred from taking another better vaccine because they have already been injected if they get reinfected. Right now there's not enough transparency with Sinovac.

It is another step forward in the Republic's bid to control the Covid-19 outbreak. Sources told The Straits Times that the vaccine was ferried by a Singapore Airlines plane that took off from Brussels in Belgium and transited at Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. The plane was expected to touch down at Changi Airport at about 2.15pm but arrived ahead of schedule. The Ministry of Health initially said on Feb 3 that the first shipment of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine would arrive around March, provided there were no disruptions to the shipment schedule. The vaccine is the second Covid-19 vaccine to be approved for use in Singapore after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which was approved in mid-December. The Health Sciences Authority said on Feb 3 that its review of the available clinical data found that the Moderna vaccine demonstrated a high efficacy of 94 per cent, with the benefits outweighing the risks. This means that there is a 94 per cent reduction of symptomatic Covid-19 disease in a vaccinated group of people, compared with a similarly sized group of unvaccinated people, it said.",17/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"South Africa asks Serum Institute to take back 1 million vaccine doses - report BENGALURU (Reuters) - South Africa has asked the Serum Institute of India to take back the one million COVID-19 vaccine doses the company had sent in early February, The Economic Times reported on Tuesday, a week after the country said it will put on hold use of AstraZeneca's shot in its vaccination program. Serum Institute of India, which is producing AstraZeneca's shot, has emerged as a key vaccine supplier. One million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine landed in South Africa last week and another 500,000 were due to arrive in the next few weeks. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. South Africa's health minister has said the government may sell doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, after the country paused its rollout following a small clinical trial that showed it offered minimal protection against mild to moderate illness from the 501Y.V2 coronavirus variant dominant in the country. AstraZeneca has said its vaccine appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant, based on data from a study by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford University. The African country, which is yet to launch its COVID-19 vaccination program, has decided to start vaccinating health workers with Johnson & Johnson's vaccine in the form of an ""implementation study"" with researchers. The Economic Times report also comes as the World Health Organization on Monday listed the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.

"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news...being-n1257885 A 78-year-old woman died shortly after being inoculated at a mass vaccination site in Los Angeles County, health officials announced Saturday. The patient's family said she had a history of heart illness, said Dr. Michael E. Morris, director of Kaiser Permanente Southern California\x92s vaccination program, in a statement. The woman ""passed away unexpectedly"" Friday after receiving Pfizer's version of the Covid-19 vaccine about noon at the Kaiser-run site at Cal Poly Pomona, 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, the doctor said. ""While seated in the observation area after the injection, the patient complained of feeling discomfort and while being evaluated by medical personnel, she lost consciousness,"" he said. ""Paramedics on scene began CPR almost immediately and continued, but she ultimately could not be revived."" Her cause of death was yet to be determined, but the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said by email that there were no signs of allergic or anaphylactic reactions. ""Her death does not appear to be related to the vaccine,"" it said. The woman's husband of 57 years was also vaccinated Friday. ""Despite this tragedy, he is still urging that the COVID-19 vaccination effort continue, and said he intends to receive his second dose of vaccine in a few weeks,"" Morris said.",14/2/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...vid-19-vaccine PAP lumber 1! SINGAPORE - A staff member at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) has been erroneously administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine. This occurred during a vaccination exercise on Jan 14, said the SNEC on Saturday (Feb 6). The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination, when the staff member was resting in a designated area. ""Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff (member) was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects,"" said SNEC. The staff member was warded at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for further observation, before being discharged two days later. The SNEC said it has been following up closely with the worker, who remains well. As a safety measure, the vaccination exercise at the SNEC was stopped immediately upon detection of the error. The rest of the SNEC staff were vaccinated at SGH. ""Our investigations showed that it was human error resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team, who had been preparing and administering the injections at that time,"" said the centre. It said the worker in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine. A second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering. The SNEC has apologised to the affected staff member and the worker's family, said Professor Wong Tien Yin, who is medical director of the centre. ""SNEC takes a very serious view of this incident. The safety of those receiving the vaccination during our staff vaccination exercise is of our utmost priority,"" he added. He added that the centre has done a thorough review of its internal processes and taken steps to tighten them so that such lapses do not occur again. SNEC is not involved in the vaccination exercise for other groups. As at Tuesday, more than 175,000 people have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. About 6,000 people have also taken their second dose of the vaccine and completed the full vaccination regimen.",2/6/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"Getting more than recommended dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine unlikely to be harmful: MOH The Health Ministry's comments come after an employee from the Singapore National Eye Centre was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the vaccine due to a human error. File photo of a healthcare worker preparing a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Singapore. (File photo: Jeremy Long) SINGAPORE: Receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful, said Singapore's Ministry of Health (MOH) on Saturday (Feb 6), citing clinical trial data from the two pharmaceutical companies. This comes after an employee from the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the vaccine due to a human error. The recommended schedule for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is two doses, 21 days apart. \x93Clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful,\x94 said MOH in response to CNA\x92s queries. \x93The affected staff is well, and did not have any adverse reaction or side effects.\x94 MOH said the incident at SNEC is an isolated one due to a human error by a staff member administering the vaccine, adding that it has not been notified of any similar incidents at other vaccination sites. The error happened on Jan 14 during a vaccination exercise conducted at SNEC for its staff members. According to SNEC in an earlier media release, investigations showed that the error resulted from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. \x93The staff in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine, and a second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering,\x94 said SNEC. The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination when the affected employee was resting in a designated area after the jab. As a precaution, the affected employee was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for observation as was discharged two days later. AFFECTED STAFF SCHEDULED FOR SECOND DOSAGE PENDING TEST RESULTS In response to CNA's queries, the eye centre said the affected employee remains well and is scheduled for the second dosage of the vaccine, pending the blood serology test results. ""We will continue to monitor the staff\x92s health closely and provide the necessary support to the staff and family. The staff is currently well and back to work,"" it said. On why it made the error public more than three weeks after the incident, SNEC said: ""Our immediate priority is the well-being of the affected staff. We were focused on ensuring that the staff remains well, with no adverse reaction or side effects. We also wanted to respect the privacy of the staff and the staff\x92s family members."" It added that after the vaccination exercise at SNEC was immediately suspended, it focused on investigations and putting in place measures to ensure that such lapses do not happen again. ""In the meantime, we kept the Ministry of Health informed on the health of the staff and on our investigation,"" said SNEC. The employee responsible for administering the erroneous injection has been counselled, it added. MOH said there are \x93robust medical protocols in place\x94 at all COVID-19 vaccination sites to ensure the safety of people who received the jab. \x93These include protocols for vaccination processes on dose preparation, dilution and vaccine administration, including the need for clear indication to differentiate diluted and undiluted vaccine vials,\x94 said the ministry. \x93Following the incident, we have reminded vaccination providers to adhere strictly to the protocols,\x94 it added. \x93The safety and health of those receiving the vaccine are our top priority. MOH will continue to work with vaccination providers to ensure the utmost safety in the vaccination process.\x94 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...7236?cid=FBcna",2/6/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"SIA's SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am, carrying a crew of 12.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG SIA's vaccinated crew before their flight to Jakarta.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG SINGAPORE - The first Singapore Airlines (SIA) flight staffed by pilots and cabin crew vaccinated against the coronavirus left Changi Airport on Thursday (Feb 11), marking a significant milestone for the battered national carrier. Flight SQ956 took off for Jakarta at 9.30am carrying a crew of 12, and is the first of three departing SIA Group flights with crew who have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Scoot flight TR606 to Bangkok also left Changi at 9.30am with a set of 11 vaccinated crew members, while SilkAir's first vaccinated flight MI608 will leave for Phnom Penh at 4.30pm with a crew of eight. The crew members are among more than 52,000 personnel in the transport sector who have received their first dose of the vaccine as at Feb 10. The Ministry of Transport said more than 39,000 workers in the aviation and maritime sectors have gotten their first jab - over 90 per cent of the 43,000 front-liners in both sectors. More than 14,000 land transport workers have also received the first dose of the vaccine, with the remaining 66,000 scheduled to get their jabs in the coming months. In a statement, SIA Group, which has suffered billions in losses because of the ongoing pandemic, said it is among the first airlines in the world to operate flights with fully vaccinated crews. Noting that the Government has prioritised the aviation sector in the national drive to vaccinate Singaporeans and other long-term residents, SIA said this reflected the sector's importance and the national carrier's crucial role in Singapore's economic recovery and the fight against Covid-19. SIA chief executive Goh Choon Phong said: ""Vaccinations will be key to the reopening of borders and to enhancing travel confidence, in tandem with robust testing regimes and the wide-ranging safe management measures that are in place on the ground and in the air."" He added: ""They offer greater protection for our people and provide an added layer of assurance to our customers."" Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung, who spoke to crew members operating SQ956 on Thursday morning, said the vaccination drive has been ""proceeding like clockwork"". He told reporters he is confident that a substantial number of workers from the aviation and maritime sectors will be fully vaccinated by the end of the month. Singapore's biggest vulnerability is its border, he said, given that the virus is under control here with very few community cases. ""If the border staff that come into contact with the outside world are all vaccinated, I think we would have really taken a very big step in securing our border and keeping Singaporeans safe,"" he added. Transport Minister Ong Ye Kung speaking to SIA\x92s vaccinated crew members on Feb 11, 2021. ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG Passenger traffic at Changi Airport, which has been decimated by Covid-19, fell by 82.8 per cent last year. Front-line workers in the aviation and maritime sectors started getting jabs on Jan 13 as part of an operational trial, before the mass exercise began in earnest on Jan 18. Bus and train workers started getting jabs from Jan 25. SIA said its operating crew members have responded very positively to the exercise, with more than 90 per cent of cabin crew and pilots signing up for the vaccine to date. Its milestone comes days after a 41-year-old cabin crew member on a turnaround flight to the United Arab Emirates tested positive for the coronavirus. The Singaporean woman was the fifth person on the flight to test positive, with preliminary test results showing that all five had contracted the more infectious B117 strain of the virus. The air stewardess had departed Singapore for Dubai on Jan 30 and returned on Jan 31 without disembarking from the aircraft. She then received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Feb 2. She lost her sense of smell two days later but did not seek medical attention. Her case was eventually picked up during routine testing as required by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore. The Health Ministry reiterated on Tuesday that it takes a few weeks for individuals to build up immunity against Covid-19 after completing vaccination, and it is possible to get infected just before or after inoculation. Other airlines have also begun vaccinating their crew. Mr Ong said last month that SIA could be the first vaccinated international airline of the world. On Wednesday, Etihad Airways staked its claim as the first airline in the world to have inoculated all its operating pilots and cabin crew. The United Arab Emirates airline said in a statement that more than three-quarters of its workforce have already received at least one dose of the vaccine. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ource=facebook",2/11/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"TOKYO Japan is unlikely to inoculate as many people with Pfizer Inc's COVID-19 vaccine as planned due to a shortage of special syringes capable of extracting the final dose from vials provided by the drugmaker, health minister Norihisa Tamura said Tuesday. The country said last month that it had secured doses for 72 million people based on the assumption that each vial could provide six shots. But without low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use, a vial ends up yielding only five doses -- enough for 60 million people. ""The syringes used in Japan can only draw five doses. We will use all the syringes we have that can draw six doses, but it will, of course, not be enough as more shots are administered,"" said Tamura.

Seems like in next few months shd that happens there and a few more countries around the world, there could be a possibility of higher pressure for the mRNA ones to be modified? It's possible the same story will unfold like last year in other countries as well (USA?), exponential growth etc, gone through that already. You won't have to wait long to know if that really shd happen, and as below age 70 pax, no change in current plans, regardless.

"Engineer who received first dose of Covid-19 vaccine among 2 community cases in S'pore \ufffcBoth community cases reported on Feb 8, 2021, were detected when they went for rostered routine testing.ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG \ufffc Ang Qing PUBLISHED FEB 8, 2021, 11:03 PM SGT FACEBOOKWHATSAPP SINGAPORE - A 30-year-old Indian national who received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine on Jan 27 was among the two community cases announced on Monday night (Feb 8). The work pass holder is an engineer at Station Satcom and boards ships to install communications and IT equipment as part of his job. He was identified as a close contact of a previous case and was placed on quarantine between Jan 13 and 24. His swabs taken during quarantine and as part of rostered routine testing (RRT) - the last being on Jan 29 - were all negative for the virus. He developed fatigue on Feb 4 and a fever the next day, but did not seek medical attention, said the Ministry of Health (MOH). He was tested on Feb 5 as part of RRT and his test result came back positive the next day, and he was conveyed in an ambulance to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). ""While his serological test taken on Feb 7 has come back positive, this is assessed to be a recent infection as he is symptomatic, and the Ct value for his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was low,"" said MOH. It added that the patient's first dose of vaccine on Jan 27 accounts for his positive serology test as he has likely started producing antibodies following vaccination. ""As the vaccine does not contain live virus, he could not have been infected due to vaccination,"" said MOH, ""It is possible for one to be infected just before or just after vaccination as it typically takes a few weeks for an individual to build up immunity after completing vaccination."" The other unlinked community case is a 49-year-old bus driver who transports individuals placed on stay-home notice (SHN) from Changi Airport to dedicated facilities. His bus is disinfected after every trip, added MOH. The bus driver, who works at Cobb & Coach Services, developed a runny nose on Jan 31 but did not seek medical attention. He was detected when he was tested on Feb 5 as part of RRT. MOH added that his earlier tests from RRT - the last being on Jan 23 - were negative for Covid-19 infection and his serology test is also negative, indicating that this is likely a current infection.",2/9/21,1.0,hardwarezone

"https://www.ft.com/content/e9bbd4fe-...3-be64140a3f36 Oxford/AstraZeneca jab fails to prevent mild and moderate Covid from S African strain, study shows Impact on hospitalisations and deaths caused by variant not yet determined, according to preliminary findings The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine does not appear to offer protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the viral variant first identified in South Africa, according to a study. Although none of the more than 2,000 mainly healthy and young patients in the study died or was hospitalised, the findings, which have not yet been peer reviewed, could*complicate the race to roll out vaccines as new strains emerge. In both the human trials and tests on the blood of those vaccinated, the jab showed significantly reduced efficacy against the 501Y.V2 viral variant, which is dominant in South Africa, according to the randomised, double-blind study seen by the Financial Times. \x93A two-dose regimen of [the vaccine] did not show protection against mild-moderate Covid-19 due to [the South African variant]\x94, the study says, adding that efficacy against severe Covid-19, hospitalisations and deaths was not yet determined. While all Covid-19 vaccines so far have largely held up against the B.1.1.7 variant that emerged in the UK, the strain that originated in South Africa has been more worrying. Both Johnson & Johnson and Novavax have said their vaccines were less effective against the strain in clinical trials conducted in South Africa. In trials, both vaccines offered complete protection against severe disease and death in relation to Covid-19. Moderna has said it will test a booster shot and a reformulated vaccine to target the South African variant, after studies showed its vaccine was significantly less effective. BioNTech/Pfizer said their vaccine was slightly less effective in a lab study using a pseudovirus with some mutations from the 501Y.V2 variant, but have not published results of tests against the variant itself. There are caveats to the Oxford/AstraZeneca study, as the sample sizes were relatively small. The study, led by South Africa\x92s University of the Witwatersrand and Oxford university, enrolled 2,026 HIV negative individuals, with a median age of 31. Half the group was given at least one dose of placebo, with the other half receiving at least one dose of vaccine.",2/7/21,1.0,hardwarezone

After six months of experiments, results showed that compounds from coconut oil and VCO decreased coronavirus count by 60 percent to 90 percent at low viral load.

"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...error-14126784 SINGAPORE: An employee at the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC) was wrongly administered the equivalent of five doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine due to a human error, the public healthcare institution said on Saturday (Feb 6). The error happened on Jan 14 during a vaccination exercise conducted at SNEC for its staff members. \x93The error was discovered within minutes of the vaccination when the staff was resting in a designated area after vaccination,\x94 said SNEC in a press release. \x93Senior doctors were alerted immediately and the staff was assessed and found to be well, with no adverse reaction or side effects.\x94 READ: Getting more than recommended dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine unlikely to be harmful: MOH As a precaution, the affected employee was warded at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for observation. ""The staff\x92s condition remained stable throughout and the staff was discharged two days later. We have been following up closely with the staff, who remains well,"" said SNEC. The vaccination exercise at the eye centre was stopped immediately and the rest of its employees were vaccinated at SGH. \x93SNEC is not involved in Singapore\x92s vaccination exercise for any other groups,\x94 it said. READ: 4 out of 155,000 people vaccinated had severe allergic reactions, all have recovered According to SNEC, investigations showed that it was a human error resulting from a lapse in communication among the vaccination team at the time. \x93The staff in charge of diluting the vaccine had been called away to attend to other matters during the preparation of the vaccine, and a second staff member had mistaken the undiluted dose in the vial to be ready for administering,\x94 said SNEC. READ: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore, first shipment expected around March The eye centre has done a \x93thorough review\x94 of its internal processes and has taken steps to ensure that such lapses do not happen again, said SNEC\x92s medical director Professor Wong Tien Yin, apologising for the incident. \x93SNEC takes a very serious view of this incident. The safety of those receiving the vaccination during our staff vaccination exercise is of our utmost priority. We are extremely sorry that this incident happened,\x94 he said. \x93We have apologised to the staff concerned and the staff\x92s family. We will continue to monitor the staff\x92s health closely and provide the necessary support.\x94 In response to CNA's queries, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said clinical trial data from Pfizer-BioNTech has indicated that receiving more than the recommended dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is unlikely to be harmful. MOH added that the incident at SNEC is an isolated one, and that it has not been notified of any similar incidents at other vaccination sites. SNEC told CNA that the affected employee remains well and is scheduled for the second dosage of the vaccine, pending the blood serology test results. READ: Singapore starts vaccinating seniors against COVID-19 with pilot exercises in Tanjong Pagar, Ang Mo Kio Singapore started vaccinating its first healthcare worker on Dec 30 in a small-scale test run at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases.

"By right, vaccines are only approved AFTER the trials have been completed.   But for the Covid vaccines, the trials are still ongoing till 2023.

"These vaccines astrazeneca, moderna, pfizer, coronavac, sinovac, sputnik they all used mRNA of a virus and some genetically modified.  The character of a virus is to inject its RNA/genetic code to a host cell in the body. RNA is a single strand, that means there is no cross checking. The fighter cells thinks it's harmless because the virus disguise itself in the host cells.  The DNA (humans) is hard to copy because it has double strands, it means there is a cross checker. That's very difficult to replicate. If you inject these vaccines, aren't they making the body as virus factories?  Fatalities may rise since the priorities are the senior citizens and the vulnerable (those who has underlying sickness). If they die (God forbids) it's easy to cover it up or mask the cause of death since they will make old age and their underlying sickness as an excuse.  These vaccines are rushed and even the clinical trials. It may be good on paper but human trials are different.  Now, we must monitor rise of deaths related to the vaccinated people. We do not really know the severity of its side effecs as it may take years to come. There are reports of people dying from nursing homes in different countries after the injection.  There are also doctors and nurses who had a severe side effect and who had died. It's worrisome because the priorities of these vaccines are also the frontliners, if they die (God forbids) what's gonna happen to us?

"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,11/3/21,1.0,facebook

Such a small number of volunteers may make the efficacy rate less accurate. The Turkish scientists did not share the results in writing. Two weeks later, researchers in Brazil announced that CoronaVac has an efficacy of 78 percent. None of the vaccinated volunteers in their Phase 3 trial developed severe or moderate cases of Covid-19. However, shortly afterwards one of the scientists clarified that the efficacy estimate was based on the vaccine’s performance in just one subgroup of volunteers.

According to information from the online Sinovac vaccine trial results (12,396 people took part in the trial): 1) The chance of getting the virus is reduced by about half 2) Only 16.3 per cent of those who have been infected with the virus require medical treatment (83.7 per cent do not require medical treatment to recover). 3) No one who needs medical attention needs to be in hospital or life-threatening.",25/2/21,1.0,facebook

"Love does not come to those who seek it, but to those who give it... It comes with lots of challenges like lost marriages, lost love, financial and job problems and so many more, But still there has always been a solution to every challenges that we face in life. Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my husband. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached home, I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to our bedroom. I didn't knock the door because i wanted to surprise him because he wasn't expecting me at the time,But when i opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in our house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, He followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away.Out of shame my husband stopped picking my calls and finally blocked me. I used to cry day and night not until i had to explain everything to my best friend where had gone to have a peace of mind. she told me to fight for my man and not lose him to another woman. She gave me contact of Mama Sarah 603764121 and told me Mama Sarah +27603764121 will bring back my husband to me and love only me. So i contacted Mama Sarah +27603764121 and told her everything, she made a love and binding prayers for me and in just 3 days of the prayers my husband came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby,He cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much Mama Sarah +27603764121 your prayers indeed work. You can call or whats-app Mama Sarah +27603764121 in case you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you that even don't know the situation you are going through, all that matters are the results so feel free to contact her.",24/2/21,1.0,facebook

"What is going on with Myanmar?   1947, General Aung San was assassinated. 1948, Myanmar gained its Independent from the British Empire. 1958, Ne Win captured power through a coup d'etat.  1962, Another coup led to the end of democratic form and Myanmar became a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party. 1988, Unitary Parliamentary republic under military dictatorship & 88 generation students group 2010, Start of Democracy movements in Myanmar, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. 2020, Elections in Myanmar   1st of February 2021 Plan:  Democratically elected politicians and non-democratically elected military spokespersons meet in Naypyidaw to form a new government that will lead the country for the upcoming 5 years.   What actually happened:  1. Democratically elected politicians who were supposed to meet up, got kidnapped, by the military.  2. Citizens and public figures such as singers and writer got kidnapped for using their right of free speech to speak in favour of democracy.  3. Phone signals got cut off around 3 am in Naypyidaw.  4. The rest of the country followed.  5. Tv, radio and some internet providers got cut off. 6. Road to the airport got blocked.  7. ATMs and all banks are closed.  8. MWD announced that Myint Swe is the new President 9. The coup is official, and the country is in an emergency rule and the military will have full control over the country for at least one year.   We are worried about where they took our heroes such as our president and our grandma Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all the other politicians and public figures. At the same time, we fully support what they stand for and we are praying for them and also taking notes on how to become a great leader without fear.   We would like to encourage especially students to step up and scream for those who cant speak for such a time as this.    We do not know when they will cut off the internet in all part of the country and close the borders, but we still believe that together we can work towards a more sustainable future for Myanmar and see Myanmar become democratic.

"The 16 years old student is not a Christian.  Going to church does not make you a Christian.  Not every person who goes to church is Christian.  It is hard to be a Christian because you have to do what the Lord Jesus Christ commands instead of doing whatever you like.  The Lord Jesus Christ commanded His disciples to love one another.  Christians forgive people because of their love for them.  God does not forgive you when you do not forgive people.  A person who follows the Lord Jesus Christ has to do what pleases God instead of what pleases himself or any other person such the parents, the spouse, the children and all other people.  We must love one another and forgive each other because all of us are far from being perfect.  Let us remember to love one another so that everyone can live peacefully together.",30/1/21,1.0,facebook

"I felt hurt and heartbroken when there was a big problem in my marriage between my husband and I seven months ago. so terrible that he took the case to court to ask for a divorce. He said that he never wanted to stay with me again and that she no longer loved me. So he unpacked he bags and caused severe pain to me and my children. I tried every possible way to get him back after much begging, but to no avail and he confirmed that he had made a decision and never wanted to see me again. When I got home from work on Tuesday, I met an old friend who asked about my husband. I explained everything to him, so he told me that the only way to get my husband back was to visit a magic diffuser that helped him get through difficult times. I've never believed in spells, but I have no choice but to take your advice. the pitcher assured me that I will get my husband back the next day. What an amazing statement! I never believed, so he spoke to me and told me everything I had to do, and the next morning, surprisingly, my husband, who had not called me for the last 7 months, called to let me know he would be back. So awesome !! So he came back the same day, with much love and joy, apologizing for his mistake and for the pain he had caused me and our children. As of today our relationship is stronger than before, thanks to the help of a pitcher.

Next, we have those dependent, short term visit pass holders jetting around, as well as students returning for a one month school holiday from high risk countries putting the whole nation at risk.

Undoing the good work done by the population. Never learn the mistakes in HK several months back where they allowed ferry crew to move around and spread.

Possible to put air crew second in priority after NCID for vaccination? Safer for their families as well. Please advise them not to go gym or exercise, jogging without masks please. Think about it.

"1. It will be better if restriction is lifted in phase 2, and delay phase 3 till Jun 2021, when almost 60% population are vaccinated and trace together hit 90%. This is because,  most people will take phase 3 as pre covid-19 situation and we can celebrate. There is no phase 4 and thus, it is easily mistaken,  it is all under controlled and be complacent.  This is a bad mistake.  2. This is the mental misconception which gives covid-19 more chance to grow silently even before vaccines are already injected. The war with covid-19 is not over with Asian countries having multiple waves.    3. The moment we let our guard down and focus to open up too soon, we will suffer longer. Now we must acknowledge that covid-19 is more severe and hard to break compared to SARS,  MERS,  EBOLA,  H1N1 or other coronovirus.   4.

No one is forcing anyone to take the vaccine, hence the risk. I suggest you buy an Insurance policy to cover yourself for any eventuality as a result of the vaccine given in U.K. and be grateful that it’s free. Better still, don’t take the vaccine, stay home and help the NHS. ",6/2/21,1.0,facebook

"Well done , because Malaysia will take about 10 years to vaccinate the whole country. If they inoculate 10K dose per day x 300 days is 3 million dose a year , their population is 30million , so it will take 10 years for the first dose.... second dose, yearly booster dose, PM change, Ruling party change .....so if you consider all this factors, god knows how many decades more or this will not end in our generation. .",10/3/21,1.0,facebook
Spending some money to make the community safe. Isnâ€™t it benefiting for the society at large? More money had already been spent on securing vaccines at an early stage even before trial results are out. Money went into the drain for vaccines with results that did not reach the standard. So it is nothing to compare with giving it to them for free.   Looking far sighted and long term is what our govt have been doing. Priority should really be given to people who come into contact with larger group of people a day.   It make sense to vaccinate Malaysia delivery driver and accompany personnel looking at the high covid rate there. This will keep Singaporean in contact with them safe and in turn prevent spread of covid to locals or forming of a covid cluster thru them. ,9/3/21,1.0,facebook

Than when govt said they had 2 vaccines (Moderna), people blamed the govt ""Why bought the vacvine when there is still side effects (knowing most if not all medicines have side effects)"".   After the 3rd vaccine (Sinovac) arrived in Singapore, people said govt double standard. Why some took Pfizer n why Not everyone given Pfizer (sound contradicting compare their views when govt first announced they bought Pfizer).   Than when govt roll out to old age citizens to take the vaccine, they blamed the govt for using the old age as guinea pig, some even urging other not to take the vaccine. Now the govt said giving those invited lorry driver the vaccine (which these group of people urging Singaporean NOT to take) the same group blamed the govt.

"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,11/3/21,1.0,facebook

"Netizens and experts are calling for the US government to release information on the suspension of an infectious disease research lab under the US Army, as a petition on the White House website listed coincident events between the closure and the outbreak of COVID-19, urging the US government to clarify whether the lab was related to the deadly virus.   While the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown and conspiracy theories have caused widespread panic, experts said that timely information disclosure to the public would benefit global unity and cooperation against the pandemic, which had infected more than 150,000 people and killed 5,400 around the world as of Saturday.    The Fort Detrick laboratory that handles high-level disease-causing material, such as Ebola, in Fredrick, Maryland was shut after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a cease and desist order to the organization in July, 2019 according to local media.  The suspension was due to multiple causes, including failure to follow local procedures and a lack of periodic recertification training for workers in the biocontainment laboratories. The wastewater decontamination system of the lab also failed to meet standards set by the Federal Select Agent Program, media reported.  The lab, which was closed more than half a year ago, recently caught public attention as a petition submitted to the White House website on March 10 listed some coincidences in time between the closure and the COVID-19 outbreak.   For example, ""a large-scale 'influenza' killed more than 10,000 people"" in the US in August 2019 following the closure; and the COVID-19 epidemic broke out globally in February 2020 after the US organized Event 201 - A Global Pandemic Exercise - in October 2019.   The petition also noted that many English-language news reports about the closure of Fort Detrick were deleted amid the worsening COVID-19 pandemic, raising suspicions over the lab's relationship with the novel coronavirus.   Petitioners urged the US government to publish the real reason for the lab's closure and to clarify whether the lab was related to the novel coronavirus and whether there was a virus leak.   ""It's not a small issue, the truth should be published,"" an internet user commented.   ""The world deserves to know the truth,"" said another.   Ni Feng, a deputy director of the Institute of American Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, called on the US government to increase transparency in the COVID-19 pandemic related issues in response to wide-spread doubts.     The origin of the virus should be decided according to scientific research, but the urgent issue at the current stage is to cooperate in the global battle against the pandemic, Ni noted.",9/3/21,1.0,facebook

"vaccine passport.  WHO implement this policy on those world citizens who will be in public area for whatever activities (daily routine life) unless the citizens plan to remain stay in house forever and continue his/her daily routine (buy food/groceries online, work form home, in short whatever does in door until death) in the house (or it's compound area)for life.   However definitely those who hv vaccinated can freely stay or do whatever with the person who hv not vaccinated only in the house not in public area.   In short, those vaccinated, can leave house for shopping (buy groceries,etc) eats in restaurants, walk freely in public area, carry out daily prays in worship house, carry out whatever their religion events, prays aboard and in the country, travel across, cross state boards, attend weddings,  in other words do whatever in public area as usual. Hope understand the term "" public area"" (as you leave your house it's public area.    In any emergency (illness, sick) the unvaccinated person will be given in house treatment. Generally it will be complex part of life for those reject to accept vaccinated.   You may say this is indirect force attempt from your govt. This depends on your govt, to voice out  towards WHO as it is against human rights.   Either the citizens can do so.   It's not going to be easy, as until now the international human rights didn't say a word about this.   Here the politician plays very important role, either to defend their citizens either ignore it.   Vaccine is great effort, it's results for long term.govts fail to control birth esp among the citizens who comes under poverty line, as govts can't anymore allocate billions for education,health,homes,welfare funds,etc for the poor, as year by year this group of people (population) increase tremdously.   As this group of citizens hv big families, govt fail to educate, implement strict laws on family planning policy,etc.   The smaller the population easier to control ( political interest).   This is easiest part where the vaccine plays it's role.   As everything is well plan, who and whom should be given which dose. the other part is there will be new norma life, work from home, entrepreneurs/employer save on office rental, less cars on roads, whatever daily routine can be casey out through online   (internet and communication device, etc) huge change in many economic sectors, it's all about save cost, the employer gains.   There is con and pro.   Whatever coming back to vaccine passport is against human rights, let's see what's happen nxt.   There is some extremist ideologies remark on this,   "" if politicians (govt) plan to implement this vaccine passport and if fail to solved through out the human rights efforts, then the last option left for extremist to carry out assassination to vanish all those politicians and whoever part of this vaccine passport policy, it is better to vanish the politicians then vanishing the poor citizens """,11/3/21,1.0,facebook

"Pfizer's CEO, executives and board members refused to lead by taking their own vaccine early?? Despite knowing it'll have one of the greatest effect on vaccine hesitancy? Just, wow. Also surprised that I haven't seen this old news.  Between saving more lives by reducing vaccine hesitancy, and reaping in more profits from increased demand, what could be preventing them from getting vaccinated early?  Still waiting for news of them taking the vaccine. It's probably reasonable to assume they have not yet gotten themselves vaccinated.  Surely the Pfizer executives would have the best information to weigh risk-benefit? Why should Singaporeans believe benefits outweigh risks, when Pfizer executives haven't demonstrated belief in their own product, in America with much higher covid risks?  For people that still think ""not cutting the line"" is a valid excuse, consider that they've sold vaccines to Singapore, which should be at the very back of the line, due to how well covid is controlled, compared to most other nations.  "" our company ran a lot of polls to see what would take people to believe it. And one of the highest ranking â€“ even higher than if Joe Biden takes it, even higher than if the other presidents take it, is if the CEO of the company takes it. So with that in mind, Iâ€™m trying to find a way that I will get vaccinated despite if it is not my time just to demonstrate the confidence of the company. But we have made the decision that if we have to do that, we will not do it with our executives. So none of the executives and board members will cut the line. They will take it as their age and occupation type is the time for them to take it.

He went on to say that Sinovac had denied reports that Brazil would get a similar vaccine at a much lower price of $1.96 per dosage. â€œThe $1.96 price per dosage price is incorrect, because the shipping cost alone is at least $2 per dosage. Sinovac is currently seeking the origins of this report,â€ he added. Honesti said the decision to set the potential vaccine price was based on the amount of investment put into phase three of the clinical trials and the efficacy test.  https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/10/13/covid-19-vaccine-to-be-priced-at-rp-200000-per-dosage-bio-farma.html",4/3/21,1.0,facebook

"We are not safe until everyone in the world is safe.   Vaccination helps prevent death and serious illness from COVID-19, but it may be less effective in preventing infection by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.  The virus and the disease are 2 different things.   In simple terms, those who have the disease are definitely infected by the virus, but those who are infected by the virus may not necessarily get the disease. This can be explained by the many asymptomatic carriers of the virus.  Meanwhile, everybody should continue to observe safe measures. ",26/2/21,1.0,facebook
"With all due respect for a normally competent government, this is a dangerous path that is being proposed.  â€œPreventing new outbreaksâ€ is not a useful risk measure, â€œpreventing material excess deathsâ€, or â€œpreventing material stress on the hospitalisationâ€ could be. Preventing new outbreaks has the (popular) zero risk sound to it.   Getting the population vaccinated largely makes sense and speeding up would even be better.   â€œThe world having the virus under controlâ€ is a meaningless phrase unless itâ€™s qualified by what risks are to be prevented. Otherwise itâ€™s very easy to drift into zero risk territory again.   Itâ€™s very populistic to stay in the abstract and have an external catch all condition that means all and nothing. The government is typically much better at being precise, actionable and practical.   Prevent excess deaths and excess hospitalisation by a focused and accelerated vaccine programme would be imho a better message. ",25/2/21,1.0,facebook

"My understanding of vaccines:  If vaccinated, the body's resistance to the virus increases, then: 1) The chance of getting the virus decreases. 2) Even if you get the virus, most people don't need medical attention to recover. 3) Even if medical care is required, most do not need to be in hospital. 4) Even if you need to stay in a hospital, most will not be life-threatening.  According to information from the online Sinovac vaccine trial results (12,396 people took part in the trial): 1) The chance of getting the virus is reduced by about half 2) Only 16.3 per cent of those who have been infected with the virus require medical treatment (83.7 per cent do not require medical treatment to recover). 3) No one who needs medical attention needs to be in hospital or life-threatening.",25/2/21,1.0,facebook

"Firstly, I would say, those haters of China aka ermao need to understand better how the 2 continent vaccine works. Rather than just pin point on the origin of the vaccine. Just look at the method or approach used. West vaccine is new method, which is not proven. Just a trial, which they inject the virus (unharmful amount) and let your body build immunity to the virus. So, question, what happens if your body didnâ€™t react to it? So, what happens to this amount of virus? Will it mutate to a new string? Will it create a new disease? East method, which is similar to BCG vaccine. It kills the virus to a certain amount n your body picks it up n build immunity to it. It is a proven method for decades.... if u have no virus in your body, basically nothing happens. So, why would u say it is more harmful for the east method? Canâ€™t really understand these haters opinion",25/2/21,1.0,facebook

I'm so excited my broken relationship has been restored & my husband is back after he left me and our 2 kids for another woman. after 10years of marriage, me and my husband has been living happily together until June he suddenly changed and left me and our kids and moved to California to be with another mistress. i felt my life was over and my kids thought they would never see their father again. i tried to be strong just for the kids but i could not control the pains that torments my heart, my heart was filled with sorrows and pains because i was really in love with my husband. Every day and night i think of him and always wish he would come back to me, I was really upset and i needed help, so i searched for help online and I came across PROPHET SHANGO that he can help get ex back fast. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he told me what to do and i did it then he did a (Love spell) for me 48 hours later, my husband called me and told me that he miss me and the kids so much, So Amazing!! So that was how he came back that same day, with lots of love and joy, and he apologized for his mistake, and for the pain he caused me and the kids. Then from that day,our Marriage was now stronger than how it were before,All thanks to prophet sanoawo  he is so powerful and i decided to share my story on the internet that Prophet SHANGO  is real and powerful spell caster. if you are here and you need your Ex back or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact this powerful spell caster now.1)If you want your ex back.

"Did you know only 94 people were selected for 'tests before approval of Pfizer vaccine ?Talk about a quickie..  Dr Julian Tang, Honorary Associate Professor in Respiratory Sciences and Clinical Virologist, University of Leicester, said:  â€œThe results for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine are encouraging â€“ but it is so far based on the outcomes of only 94 participants.   â€œIf the 90% â€˜efficacyâ€™ was based on the analysis of 10,000 participants, along with similar safety data, this would be much more reassuring.  â€œOther practical problems still need to be addressed â€“ how will GPs and other providers deal with the -70C storage?  How long can the defrosted vaccine remain useable (up to 5 days?) â€“ so there will be inevitably some wastage if a certain number of doses are defrosted that are then just not used in time?  â€œAlso this is a new vaccine design â€“ we donâ€™t have any other routinely used licensed viral vaccines based on this mRNA technology.  So how will the vaccine perform if repeated boosts are needed if the duration of the vaccine-induced immunity is relatively short?  â€œAnd how will the vaccine perform in the elderly and those with comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension and other chronic heart, lung, kidney disease that make them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19?  â€œWhat about the performance if the vaccine in those who have already had COVID-19 and have circulating antibodies?  â€œWhat is the reason for those who fail to respond to this vaccine?  And will this also be a problem for other COVID-19 vaccines for those individuals?  â€œHopefully more data will be forthcoming to give us more reassurance about the efficacy and safety of this new Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine â€“ and help us understand and perhaps even predict, to some extent, the responses to the other COVID-19 vaccines that are currently in development.â€  Prof Jonathan Ball, Professor of Molecular Virology, University of Nottingham, said:  â€œItâ€™s great news that the Pfizer vaccine is reported to be 90% effective, but itâ€™s important to understand what that means.  For a vaccine to be truly effective it needs to protect those most vulnerable from suffering severe COVID-19 or prevent those less vulnerable from becoming infected and then transmitting the virus to others.

"[ The Fourth Industrial Revolution is of a scale, speed and complexity that is unprecedented. It is characterised by a fusion of technologies â€“ such as artificial intelligence, gene editing and advanced robotics â€“ that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital and biological worlds. It will disrupt nearly every industry in every country, creating new opportunities and challenges for people, places and businesses to which we must respond. ]  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/regulation-for-the-fourth-industrial-revolution  [ PROCUREMENT PROCESS Three vaccines soon looked viable - Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac. The first two vaccines use the new messenger RNA technology. Sinovac is a traditional inactivated virus vaccine.  mRNA vaccines teach our cells to make a protein that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. This is different from traditional vaccines that put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies.  The group made its first advance purchase agreement with Moderna in June, securing it with a down payment. In August, it bought the Sinovac vaccine and advanced talks with Pfizer-BioNTech.  Though Moderna appeared to be the frontrunner, the US Food and Drug Administration gave its stamp of approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine earlier, on Dec 11.  Singapore followed suit, with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announcing in a televised address on Dec 15 that the Health Sciences Authority had approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ] https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-covid-19-vaccine-shipment-edb-shortlist-negotiate-13823698  [ Recognizing the broad potential of mRNA science, we set out to create an mRNA technology platform that functions very much like an operating system on a computer. It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs.

"I think it's a good move with or without persuasion, it's effective against stage 1 at least, mutated versions are norms of virus genetic behaviour of adaptation. It's similar to hepatitis jabs which requires 1 or 2 vaccination for it to be effective. Procastinate and this will lead to daily risk of possible infection. Get protected first, side 3ffects varies from persons to persons like slight feverish, feeling weak for the first few days, etc.. An infected person can't be vaccinated, that how vaccine works, it protects the uninfected staying guarded using our bodies antibodies replicating the mrna strain to develope immunity to fight off or neutralize potential viral infection. Then again, perhaps the ministry could provide more information for people with allergies and how much if any, impact it may render to persons with allergies, would it be safe for those with allergies to get vaccinated and would the vaccine be effective if anti allergy pills are taken prior or post vaccination, or whether it poses any more eminent danger such as death for allergy peeps.

"People are dying. A former  Japanese Minister died of covid 19 recently at only 53 years old. Covid 19 can touch anyone and can be fatal even to young people. Every country is hungry for the vaccine to protect its people. Singapore is lucky to be the first Asian country to receive the first batch of limited covid 19 vaccine. The Committee has recommended that the higher risk frontline staff should be protected first with the vaccine. It is understandable that people can have reservation on the vaccine. Experts have studied how vaccine works not for one year or four years but over a century. There is no need for them to approve it if it is not safe for use. Should the vaccine goes wrong, not only it will ruin their reputation, they may also be charged for manslaughter. But for people to say that they know better than these experts that the vaccine is not safe. How? Through what expertise do they know about vaccine? The key to protect our loved ones and others is through inoculation of the vaccine. The earlier the world is inoculated, the earlier our loved ones are protected, the soonest the demise of covid 19 pandemic.",29/12/20,1.0,facebook
"A few thoughts come into my mind ( since vaccination is not made mandatory )  1.  Have an indicator (dial, dashboard etc) indicating % of Residents in SG having vaccinated.  This should help publicise Singapore as being a safer city to conduct business.  This indicator must be updated daily and available on all main stream media.  2.  Like NEWATER, where ministers YAM SENG to the newater bottle, similarly, all Ministers, Mayors, MPs, the Expert Committee can do the same to lead by example and show the world we don't talk but do.  By default, all Superscale officers must lead by having vaccination.  How do we otherwise achieve herd mentality where the leaders at the top just say charge and stay behind the troops.  3.  There could be an app ( perhaps and extension of TraceTogether ) which gives you a virtual passport that you have been vaccinated.  With vaccination comes privileges, perhaps the privilege for travel.  4.  All front line medical staff. including Safety Distancing Ambassdors, must be part of the wave.  Healthcare workers from Head of Departments, Doctors and nurses must go take the vaccination.  How do we achieve 70% vaccination when our healthcare workers are not even 100%.  Teachers who interact with students must be vaccinated.  In fact, while it's voluntary, make it a criteria for getting bonus.  In the 70s, ligation was used to provide benefits for mothers who wanted to stop at 2 and was highly successful.     5.  The currently announced ""staging plan"" looked skimpy.  There must be more meat.    6.  Have competition to show which constituency is leading the vaccination penetration.    Let's do this the Uniquely Singapore way.  It's the execution that counts.  And the sooner we get more vaccinated, the faster will be the economic recovery of Singapore!",29/12/20,1.0,facebook

"From the official CDC Covid-19 method document for the PCR Covid-19 test.  Page 2 â€œResults are for the identification of 2019-nCoV RNA.  . Positive results are indicative of active infection with 2019-nCoV but do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.  ..........  Page 39 â€œDetection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms.â€  â€œSince no quantified virus isolates of the 2019-nCoV are currently available, assays designed for detection of the 2019-nCoV RNA were tested with characterized stocks of in vitro transcribed full length RNA (N gene; GenBank accession: MN908947.2) of known titer (RNA copies/Î¼L) spiked into a diluent consisting of a suspension of human A549 cells and viral transport medium (VTM) to mimic clinical specimen.â€  Budâ€™s comments:  The PCR test has multiple probes designed insilico (i.e. in a computer) from the GenBank sequence database based on the N gene, not from isolated and validated sequence of SARS CoV-2.  The N gene sequence codes for the glycoprotein coating that encapsulates and protects the RNA in the virus from nucleases in the body which would break apart the RNA sequence of the virus.   The CDC document is very concerning.  Without validation against isolated, filtered virus using either standard Kochâ€™s or Riversâ€™ postulates (methods which have been used to validate cause for every other pandemic including SARS CoV-1 from the 2002-2004 pandemic), vaccines are being created based on synthetic sequence designed to cause invivo human cells in the living, healthy patient to produce one or more proteins from the S-spike protein on the virus, but neither this sequence nor the protein it produces has been validated against the sequence of the S-spike protein on isolated SARS CoV2.  Billions of dollars are being spent on tests and vaccines which have not been validated against actual SARS CoV-2.",12/12/20,0.0,facebook

Now it is very obvious vaccine is premature.

"Just providing an alternative perspective, to be cautious when looking at the COVID-19 vaccine... Adverse Reactions During Vaccine Trials The media appears to have played down the severity of adverse reactions from vaccine trials. However, the results are actually quite worrying. Take, for example, the genetically engineered mRNA vaccine from Moderna. Its Phase I trial involved 45 subjects (between 18 and 55 years of age), divided into three groups of 15, each group receiving two inoculations, one month apart, each at three dose levels, 25 Âµg, 100 Âµg and 250 Âµg.  Every single test subject on the highest and on the preferred intermediate dose suffered some kind of adverse reaction. At the lowest dose, 1 out of the 13 subjects became so sick that he or she had to be hospitalized, with 7 out of 13 (54%) having adverse events. 80% of those on the intermediate dose suffered a moderately severe adverse reaction (with the other 20% suffering mild adverse reactions). At the highest dose, all 14 subjects experienced adverse events with 21% (3 out of 14) of subjects suffering â€œone or more severe adverse eventsâ€. The trial was based on exclusionary volunteer selection â€“ in other words, the healthiest volunteers were selected to be test subjects for the trial, and not those who were immunocompromised. Individuals who were pregnant, overweight, smokers, suffering from respiratory problems, have a history of seizures in the family, suffering from autoimmune diseases and so forth were excluded.

"No Long-Term Safety Studies Of mRNA Vaccines Modernaâ€™s vaccine candidate, as well as the Duke-NUS vaccine candidate, are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are a new invention and have never been administered on anyone (save the volunteers currently involved in trials), let alone on the entire population. Therefore, there has not been any long-term studies on the safety of mRNA vaccines. Antibody-Dependent Response of Vaccines Not Tested â€“ Likely to Result in Deaths of Those Vaccinated Since the first SARS outbreak in 2003, scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine for SARS. However, the development of an effective vaccine for SARS has proven to be very problematic. One study is indicative. Ferrets were injected with experimental vaccines and then exposed to the live SARS virus. When examined, the ferrets were found to have developed severe hepatitis indicating liver damage.  This is due to an effect known as Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). ADE occurs when a vaccine produces binding antibodies instead of neutralizing antibodies. The binding antibodies help the viruses to enter the cells of organs more easily. A dengue vaccine introduced into the Philippines was halted and recalled in 2017 after at least 130 children died from ADE caused by the vaccine, despite the vaccine having been already approved by the World Health Organization as being safe.  Since administering a challenge test (exposure to the actual virus) is deemed to be unethical in human trials, it will not be known whether the COVID-19 vaccines currently in trials will cause ADE in humans.

"Virus Interference Could Cause The Vaccinated To Be More Susceptible to Future COVID-19 Virus Mutations There is already evidence showing that the current COVID-19 strains are mutating. How confident can we be that the vaccines that are currently being developed will still be effective by the time they are released into the market? If the current COVID-19 strains are mutating, we may face problems in future if we are currently vaccinated for one particular strain of the COVID-19 virus. Studies show that after administration of the flu vaccine, there is a 440% increase in the likelihood of being infected by other non-flu viruses.  This phenomenon, known as virus interference, may cause those vaccinated with the current COVID-19 vaccines to be more susceptible to infection by future mutations of the COVID-19 virus.   Pharmaceutical Companies Likely Immune From Legal Liability, Liability Likely To Be Borne By Governments The pharmaceutical companies creating the COVID-19 vaccines have already sought immunity from liability for harm caused by the vaccines.  If these vaccines cause harm, the financial liability is likely to fall on the governments which mandate them. This will not be the first time that governments have to bear liability. For instance, the United Kingdom government paid out Â£60 million to 60 individuals who suffered brain damage from the swine flu vaccine in 2014.  Immunity from liability, plus the potential to earn billions of dollars from the COVID-19 vaccines being developed, is a recipe for temptation that may lead pharmaceutical companies to cut corners and rush the vaccines into the market instead of taking adequate time to ensure the safety of these vaccines.

"Published in Nature Biotechnology Journal - Coronavirus vaccine developers wary of errant antibodies. Concerns persist that COVID-19 vaccines could cause antibody-dependent enhancement, which can potentiate viral entry into host cells and worsen disease. that vaccines generating antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 may bind to the virus without neutralizing it. Should this happen, the non-neutralizing antibodies could enhance viral entry into cells and viral replication and end up worsening infection instead of offering protection. ""if the gun is jumped, and a vaccine is widely distributed that is disease enhancing, that would be worse than actually not doing any vaccination at all.â€  Vaccines typically take at least 7 years for development. Long term impact must be studied. The most recent ADE related adverse impact was seen in the dengue vaccine which was approved by WHO and given to children in Philippines. It was halted after 130 children died after being vaccinated.  Please make effort to boost your own immune system through proper diet, lifestyle, sleep, avoid smoking, etc  ",1/9/20,1.0,facebook

"Dear MOH, is it MOH intention or SOP to make elderly wait for at least 3 hours for vaccination?   Me, my hubby and kid went all the way from the south to the north to fetch my mum from Yishun to Woodlands Galaxy CC on Saturday 27 Feb. My mum waited 1 hr for a queue number ticket. The PA staff (I assume) advised the crowd to return home, register for a new date again and come back another day. Some were dismayed and argued with the staff, some feedbacked they don’t know technology. I told the staff that “this is last thing I wanna hear after coming all the way here”.  I was bewildered, if you have expected weekends to be so crowded and tedious waiting, why set these seniors appointments on Saturday? Not to mention young people are also allowed to register during this period which I thought is supposed to prioritize the seniors... if not for the staff to suggest we could collect a queue tix, leave for dinner and come back 2 hrs later to take the jab, I would be more annoyed. He has provided an App to show the queue status.   After returning to the CC, my mum had to wait for another hour seated in the indoor auditorium to get the jab.. we were all beat and exhausted, I am sure other seniors and their caregivers also feel the same.",28/2/21,1.0,facebook

Not MOH staff.. How could they be authorised to handle personal data?   Would this be considered a breach of PDPA?

"THE PFIZER–BIONTECH AND MODERNA mRNA VACCINES ARE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA).  IN CLINICAL TRIALS, BOTH WERE FOUND TO BE 95 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AFTER GETTING THE BOOSTER DOSE.  BUT WE NEED 100% VACCINES NOT 95% AS OUR DEATH RATES ARE VERY LOW.  mRNA VACCINES DO NOT CONTAIN A WEAKENED OR INACTIVE FORM OF THE VIRUS ITSELF.  INSTEAD, THEY USE MESSENGER RNA (mRNA) TO TEACH THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RECOGNISE AND REACT TO A COMPONENT OF THE VIRUS THAT IS KEY TO ITS ABILITY TO MAKE US SICK.  VIRUSES CAN’T REPRODUCE THEMSELVES, THEY NEED A HOST—THE CORONAVIRUS USES A SPIKE PROTEIN TO GAIN ENTRY INTO THE CELLS AND START THE REPLICATION PROCESS THAT MAKES US SICK.  IN DEVELOPING mRNA VACCINES, SCIENTISTS ZEROED IN ON A UNIQUE SPIKE PROTEIN THAT IS FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE VIRUS.  ON ITS OWN, THIS SPIKE PROTEIN IS INCAPABLE OF CAUSING COVID-19.  THE mRNA VACCINES WORK BY RELAYING A SET OF INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO BUILD THIS PROTEIN, WITH THE GOAL OF TEACHING YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HOW TO DISARM IT.  AFTER INJECTION, THE VACCINE PARTICLES COME INTO CONTACT WITH IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS AND DELIVER THE mRNA MESSAGE.  YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS SPIKE PROTEIN, AND HERE’S HOW—AS THE VACCINATED CELLS START CHURNING OUT THE SPIKE PROTEIN, OTHER IMMUNE SYSTEM CELLS REALISE THAT THE PROTEIN SHOULD NOT BE THERE, THAT’S WHEN THE BATTLE BEGINS.  THE IMMUNE SYSTEM STARTS BUILDING AN IMMUNE RESPONSE AND MAKING ANTIBODIES.  YOUR BODY CONTINUES TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL ALL THE SPIKE PROTEINS HAVE BEEN DESTROYED.  AT THE END OF THIS NATURAL IMMUNE PROCESS, YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM HAS THE KNOWLEDGE IT NEEDS TO RECOGNISE THE SPIKE PROTEIN AND FEND OFF FUTURE EXPOSURE TO THE VIRUS.  SO IF THE VIRUS ENTERS THE BODY, THE IMMUNE SYSTEM WILL IDENTIFY AND ATTACK IT.  COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES ARE GIVEN IN THE UPPER ARM MUSCLE—ONCE THE INSTRUCTIONS (mRNA) ARE INSIDE THE IMMUNE CELLS, THE CELLS USE THEM TO MAKE THE PROTEIN PIECE.  AFTER THE PROTEIN PIECE IS MADE, THE CELL BREAKS DOWN THE INSTRUCTIONS AND GETS RID OF THEM.  NEXT, THE CELL DISPLAYS THE PROTEIN PIECE ON ITS SURFACE.  TWO DOSES, SEPARATED BY THREE TO FOUR WEEKS, IS THE TRIED-AND-TRUE APPROACH TO GENERATE AN EFFECTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE THROUGH VACCINATION.  THE FIRST DOSE PRIMES THE IMMUNE SYSTEM AND INTRODUCES THE BODY TO THE GERM OF INTEREST—THIS ALLOWS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO PREPARE ITS DEFENSE.  THE SECOND DOSE, OR BOOSTER, PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO RAMP UP THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF THE ANTIBODIES USED TO FIGHT THE VIRUS.  IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO SPREAD THE VIRUS AFTER BEING VACCINATED, SO MASKING UP AND SOCIAL DISTANCING REMANS CRITICAL.  PFIZER AND MODERNA VACCINES USE MESSENGER RNA THAT ENCODES THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN. UPON INJECTION OF THE VACCINE, THE MRNA ENTERS INTO IMMUNE CELLS CALLED DENDRITIC CELLS.   THE DENDRITIC CELLS USE THE INSTRUCTIONS WRITTEN IN THE mRNA TO SYNTHESISE THE HALLMARK SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN, WHICH CHARACTERISES THE SARS-COV-2 VIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THESE IMMUNE CELLS THEN SHOW THE SPIKE GLYCOPROTEIN TO B-CELLS, WHICH THEN MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES.  THE mRNA VACCINES ARE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF INDUCING A SPECIAL KIND OF IMMUNE CELL (CALLED A T-FOLLICULAR HELPER CELL) TO HELP B-CELLS PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  THE T-CELLS DO THIS THROUGH DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE B-CELLS AND BY SENDING CHEMICAL SIGNALS THAT TELL THE B-CELLS TO PRODUCE ANTIBODIES.  IT IS THIS HELP IN ANTIBODY PRODUCTION THAT MAKES THESE VACCINES EFFECTIVE.  BUT NOT ALL B-CELLS ARE THE SAME.  THERE ARE TWO KINDS THAT MAKE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODIES—LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS AND MEMORY B-CELLS.  THE LONG-LIVED PLASMA CELLS, AS THEIR NAME IMPLIES, LIVE IN THE BONE MARROW FOR YEARS AFTER VACCINATION, CONTINUOUSLY CHURNING OUT ANTIBODY (IN THIS CASE ANTI-SPIKE ANTIBODY), THESE LONG-LIVED B-CELLS DO NOT NEED TO BE BOOSTED.  THE MEMORY B-CELLS, ON THE OTHER HAND, LIVE IN A STATE AKIN TO HIBERNATION.  THEY DO NOT PRODUCE ANTIBODIES UNTIL STIMULATED BY A BOOSTER OF THE VACCINE, OR ARE EXPOSED TO INFECTION WITH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT CAUSES COVID-19.  THAT IS THE REASON WE NEED THAT SECOND DOSE—TOGETHER THESE TWO TYPES OF B-CELLS PROVIDE A CONSTANT LEVEL OF PROTECTION.  THAT BOOSTER SHOT IS NECESSARY FOR THE T-CELLS TO STIMULATE THE MEMORY B-CELLS TO PRODUCE MASSIVE QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES.  IF THE BOOSTER ISN’T GIVEN WITHIN THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW, LOWER QUANTITIES OF ANTIBODIES WILL BE PRODUCED THAT MAY NOT PROVIDE AS POWERFUL PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS.  mRNA STANDS FOR MESSENGER RNA, WHICH IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR MAKING PROTEINS.  DNA, WHICH LIVES IN THE NUCLEUS OF CELLS, MAKES mRNA AND SHIPS IT OUTSIDE THE NUCLEUS TO THE SURROUNDING CELL CYTOPLASM.  ONCE IN THE CYTOPLASM, mRNA IS TRANSLATED INTO A HOST OF CELL PROTEINS AND ENZYMES.  BECAUSE OUR CELLS MAKE PROTEINS ALL THE TIME, THEY ALSO MAKE mRNA ALL THE TIME.  SOON AFER MAKING PROTEINS, mRNA BREAKS DOWN.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtprX4KcBws  IT IS A LIE OF EVIL KOSHER PHARMA THAT mRNA VACCINES CANNOT ENTER THE NUCLEUS OF THE CELL, SO IT CANNOT CHANGE YOUR DNA.  IF ANY DOCTOR TELLS THE TRUTH, HE WILL BE DE-FROCKED AND BLACK BALLED FOR LIFE.  LISTEN !!  mRNA VACCINES IN THE REALM OF IS UNCHARTED TERRITORY—IT HAS NEVER BEEN TRIED BEFORE.  THE BULLCRAP EVIL KOSHER VACCINE LOBBY GIVES IS THAT EVEN IF mRNA DID ENTER THE NUCLEUS, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONVERTED TO DNA.  THIS WOULD REQUIRE AN ENZYME CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, WHICH THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN.  THAT THE mRNA VACCINES DON'T CONTAIN AN ENZYME CALLED INTEGRASE, WHICH WOULD ALSO BE NEEDED FOR mRNA TO INSERT ITSELF INTO THE DNA—mRNA VACCINES LACK ALL OF THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ALTER DNA.  THAT THEY REMAIN IN THE CELL CYTOPLASM FOR JUST A FEW DAYS BEFORE THEY ARE DESTROYED.  BRAAAYYYYYYYYYY !  REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE IS AN RNA-DEPENDENT DNA POLYMERASE THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN MANY RETROVIRUSES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV).  HIV, HAS AN ENZYME, CALLED REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE THAT COPIES THE VIRUS’S GENETIC MATERIAL BACK INTO THE GENOME.  VIRUSES LIKE THE SARS-CoV-2 OR INFLUENZA DON’T HAVE THIS ENZYME THE SCIENTISTS VOUCH.  FOR 40 YEARS TOP SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN WAXING ELOQUENT ABOUT AIDS / HIV—THE VACCINE IS STILL “ABSCONDING”.  THEY DON’T EVEN KNOW THAT HIV IS MADE IN THE LAB !",4/2/21,0.0,facebook

But there are a small number of elderlies who may have some underlying health problems. Making the way to the jabbing stations may be a strain on them. I'm glad that the gov did not make it compulsory, but the way they are saying free vaccination is like implying they may not get it free again. This is a form of stress. I'm very stressful too. The government should extend the vaccines as free for elderly people even if they reject it the first time. That will alleviate the stress we have. ",29/1/21,1.0,facebook

"It is good to have gotten the vaccine quickly as there would be a long queue later on. However all these vaccines are cleared for emergency use which is NOW, but it also means many unknowns or 'use at own risk'. Hence SGGGOVT's advisory that getting vaccinated is not 'mandatory'. That is very nice but it is unkind (and still being pushy) to warn that those who decide against it when offered may not (I read that as shall not) get the vaccine free of charge when they decide later to have it. For the over-70 Elderlies of which I am one, that is very nasty irresponsible and a demonstration of unfilial love (I wonder if they treat their own family elders in the same way) besides our worry that our golden years to enjoy our family and this country may be at risk.  The reason that the Elderlies should be given the vaccine early because they are a higher risk of COVID-19 infection group and this will give them protection. That is a very kind and noble decision if not for the fact that if the situation gets bad, the Elderlies would get infected quickly and overcome health services to the detriment of everyone else younger. But it is still a sensible decision.  But coming back to this another kind offer to reimburse costs for serious side effects due to getting a vaccination, I believe that is provided by vaccine  manufacturers to people who agree to be used as guinea pigs in the vaccine testing. So getting a vaccination is like becoming a volunteer in the vaccine testing programs of the vaccine manufacturers. I suppose it's a bohpian when buying vaccines approved for emegency use. Whether the Expert Panel will be kindly in their verification of cases and decisions is another thing bearing in mind SG's very prudent hands on the national wallet.  It's not easy to make good decisions especially decisions to save the lives and livelihood of 6 million people. So far so good, well done  SGGOVT. But could we know how the vaccinated Elderlies are doing, by way of daily numerical stats?",29/1/21,1.0,facebook

"Good that you're moving along,  albeit at snail pace comparatively.  Please allow elderly from nearby precincts to join in if they want.  You're NOT running an election that ICs need follow residence  address.  Or the Olympian qualifiers can't be vaccinated alongside the elderly.  Do you get ""extra marks "" for registration to be ""neat and tidy "". Spreadsheets can do it for you. So what's the problem? You don't need only staff nurses to do injections. Diabetes patients on insulin can do it. Student nurses and medical students can do it. Have a 2-shift program.  If you're waiting for  2nd doses to arrive,  tell us, the public. Don't waste resource visiting homes.  Do it only if and after more than 50% reject vaccination. Let them queue again after everyone else (who want it) have had their turn.  Get logistical advice from Israel or even Indonesia.  Don't be shy.  We did get advice and help (of a different kind) for a few cohorts in NS. These countries CAN plan. 30% vaccinated.  Injections into ARMS within 24 or was it 48 hours of vaccine arrival.  Possibly from tarmac of airport?  India even had a dry run. But we ALREADY had dry runs of some sort . Remember the masks distribution? Get the same group to help you set up the logistics, control the crowd entry of ic numbers.  No need to explain the same instructions,  advice again and again.

"BREAKING NEWS Global news      Italy conducts autopsy of the coronavirus patient, massive revelation ensues.      Italy became the first country in the world to perform an autopsy.  (Autopsy) on the corpse of Covid-19 and after extensive research, it was found that Covid-19 does not exist as a virus.  But very large  It's a global scam, people have died from ""Amplified Global 5G Electromagnetic Radiation (Poison)"".       Doctors in Italy have violated the World Health Organization (WHO) law, which does not allow autopsies.  (Autopsy) on the corpses of those who have died from the corona virus to search after scientific discovery.  It cannot be assumed that it is not a virus, but rather the fatal bacteria that cause blood clots in the blood vessels, such as blood clots in the veins and nerves formed by these bacteria, and are the patients who cause death.      Italy beat the virus, stating that  ""Nothing else is hardening of the arteries in atherosclerosis  (Thromboembolism) and the way to deal with it is to cure it. ""      Antibiotic      Anti-inflammatory and      Taking an anticoagulant (aspirin) will treat it.      And it shows that a cure for the disease is possible, exciting news for the world, was provided by an Italian doctor with an autopsy.  (Post-mortem) of the coronavirus, according to many Italian scientists  People do not need a ventilator and an intensive care unit (ICU) .The protocol for this has been published in Italy.      CHINA already knows this.  But never made public      Please share this information with your family, neighbors, acquaintances, friends, coworkers, so they can escape the fear of Covid-19 and understand that this is not a virus.  Rather, it is a bacteria that is only exposed to 5G radiation, the cause is very dangerous for people with low immunity.  This radiation can also cause inflammation and lack of oxygen.  Victims should take Asprin-100mg and Apronix or Paracetamol 650mg. Why… ??? क. Since it has been proven that COVID-19 causes blood clots which cause blood clots in humans and cause blood clots.  Tonnes in the veins and because the brain, heart and lungs are unable to receive oxygen because of the difficult illness and people  Quickly died of breathing difficulties      Doctors in Italy failed to comply with WHO procedures and performed an autopsy of the COVID-19 death.Doctors opened up the limbs and other parts of the body, and after proper examination and examination, the blood vessels were dilated and the blood vessels were filled.  With thromboembolism, which often stops the blood from flowing  It also reduces the flow of oxygen into the body, which can lead to death.  Upon learning of this research, the Italian Ministry of Health immediately changed the Covid-19 treatment protocol and gave patients 100mg positive aspirin and started Empromax.As a result, patients began to recover and their health began to improve.  Italy's health ministry eliminated more than 14,000 patients in a single day and sent them home.     Source: Italian Ministry of Health",8/1/21,1.0,facebook

The correction/clarification notices to some of these articles does not take away or refute the fact that the WIV was involved in work on SARS CoV viruses to make them infectious to humans and the lab should be the subject of forensic investigations. Its really time that the Singapore govt join in calls pushes to 1) investigate the WIV lab forensically and 2) to call on China to release information on the virus over calling links to it a ""conspiracy theory"" and/or choose the path of Sinophilia and/or fear.   Note to PM Lee Hsien Loong and the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs too.",30/12/20,1.0,facebook

"THE PCR DECEPTION⎮Short Documentary About the Test Used for Covid-19 https://youtu.be/h_fmcpF8mfk  Scientists tells the truth but politicians suggests otherwise!  Every Scary Things You're Being Told Depends On The Unreliable PCR Test https://youtu.be/6ny9nNFHQsY  ACADEMY OF MEDICINE SINGAPORE, NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS https://www.ams.edu.sg/view-pdf.aspx?file=media%5C5558_fi_168.pdf&ofile=Period+of+Infectivity+Position+Statement+%28final%29+23-5-20.pdf  Sars-CoV-2 virus has not been isolated and purified. What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",31/12/20,0.0,facebook

What we get to see are animated cartoon images of the spiked virus.  When the Ct value was 30 or higher (i.e. when viral load is low), no viable virus (based on being able to culture the virus) has been found. In addition, virus could not be isolated or cultured after day 11 of illness — SARS-CoV-2 Virus has not been purified and isolated, so what is the vaccine for?  PCR machines can't diagnose an infection, it is simply a research tool.  COVID-19 PCR TESTING - FALSE POSITIVES PCR tests cannot be verified for accuracy as there is no ‘gold standard’ against which to check them. The virus has not been purified. (1)  PCR tests cannot detect viral loads and are prone to false positives. (2)  A positive PCR test does not mean that an individual is infected nor infective. (3)  In fact approximately 90% of the PCR positive ‘cases’ are false positives. We therefore have no second wave and no pandemic. (4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?",30/12/20,0.0,facebook

"On recent CNA with Gov.sg, sponsored news article on Assoc Prof Tan and also regarding yesterday MOH released news of recommendation of vaccination I have comments and questions as following:  In respect to Assoc Prof Tan and thank her for her tireless research work for our nation.   I'm concern and would like to ask base on that article written.  I didnt see any collaboration of vaccine mentioned in the article.  -In regards to Sars or Covid 19 virus-vaccine, and regarding the 2 vaccines from Pifzer and Moderna using the new mRNA technology compared to traditional vaccine,   The mentioned were as abstracted in [.] brackets from article:  1. [This information was used by several international research groups in their studies of biopsy samples from COVID-19 patients, helping us understand how the virus spreads to different organs and causes complications in some patients.]  2. [discussions with some colleagues in the engineering field on how their technologies could be adapted for developing diagnostic procedures for COVID-19 as well as other infectious diseases.]  3. [colleagues from fields such as pathology, cancer and immunology use their expertise to study COVID-19 in different ways. Combining their knowledge with innovative technologies helped us gain new knowledge of the virus quickly.]  4. [We also assisted some local companies in developing diagnostic kits that can be used at point-of-care settings, and more importantly, help to identify asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers.]   One heartened mentioned in this article saw was, [ ] abstracted:  [ In another collaboration, we detected strong virus-specific T cell immunity in people who have recovered from COVID-19 and SARS. Interestingly, those who had SARS 17 years ago still harboured T cells from their earlier infection, and those same T cells could also recognise COVID-19. This finding may be useful for the design and testing of COVID-19 vaccines. ]   Questions: 1. I would like to ask Gov taskforce, Ministry of Health, given since the Sars outbreak in 2002-2004, and no Sars vaccine was created that period of time, and people have been travelling around the world since, aren't the people developed T-cell immunity also?   From MOH website on the status of Covid19 local situation as of 27/12/2020: https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19 53,870 were Discharged  0 Hospitalised (Critical)  29 Death   On the 29 death, base on the news reported for local Singapore, most of the death the covid patients were caused by having pre existing conditions.   Q1. If 53,870 were previously diagnosed having covid 19 virus, can we say that these people had gotten the T-cell immunity of covid19  Q2. Since after phase 2 and till current date 27/12/20, the people can go out to malls, dine, shopping, the local community inflection numbers were very low, many days can be zero. Most were imported cases. Can we say that the local people had gotten herd immunity?   Q3. The safety of the 2 vaccines Pifzer and Moderna using mRNA technology - teach Human DNA cells, different from traditional method of using weakened virus, to naturally activate body immune system cells to fight the weakend virus.   Abstracted [The mRNA technology contains instructions for human cells to make proteins that mimic part of the coronavirus, and is used in vaccines from Moderna as well as from Pfizer and BioNTech.]  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/china-starts-work-on-plant-for-mrna-based-covid-19-vaccine-13816686?cid=FBcna  Aren't this new technology - giving instruction - have high risk to human DNA cells. Human DNA cells - is like a code of instruction designed by GOD for growth.  Animals, birds and plants of different species of have their set of DNA cells.  the high risk of this technologies      1. Autoimmune diesases     2. Aftecting the natural DNA cells, risking deformity in future offspring.   US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination, show that on 18/12/2020, approx 30% were hospitalised.  How is Singapore Gov taskforce and MOH still recommend frontline healthcare workers and vulnerable elderly with existing medical conditions and vascular condition to take these vaccine?  https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-19/05-COVID-CLARK.pdf  I do not have the latest update of US CDC website on active surveillance of the status of people after vaccination.  I really appreciate if Singapore Gov Taskforce, Ministry of Health, can publicly and transparently share these data, to let the People know these safety status data of people in other countries vaccination.  I also want to ask on the liabilities for compensations from these pharmaceutical companies of these 2 vaccines introduced, for any adverse reactions, side effects and long term conditions to the People , and also if MOH endorsing these vaccines. Kindly please address publicly to the people.  Last note:  Fomer Vice-president of Pifzer, Mike Yeadon mentioned the notion of having millions of healthy, fit people is ridiculous quoted below, he also shared his knowledge and reasoning in his video: [Yeadon states this notion is “ridiculous because while SARS-CoV-2 is indeed novel, coronaviruses are not. There’s no such thing as an ‘ancestor-less virus’.” Indeed, he points out, there are at least “four, endemic, common-cold inducing coronaviruses … [which] circulate freely in UK and elsewhere.” Those who have been infected by “one or more of these endemic, common-cold producing coronaviruses in the past, have a long-lived and robust [T-cell] immunity, not only to those viruses, but to closely related viruses. SARS-CoV-2 is one such closely-related virus.”] https://lbry.tv/Mike-Yeadon-Unlocked:0  A doctor whom gathered info regarding the vaccines using new technologies mRNA also shared her view: https://www.stopworldcontrol.com/madej/",28/12/20,1.0,facebook

(4 , 5)  The government’s report estimates a false positive rate of between 0.8 to 4.0 % using data from other viral infections – not from covid (6)  Viral fragments may remain in people’s bodies for several weeks following recovery from infection. (7)  The crisis will never end if we are waiting for zero positive tests. Everyone has probably had a cold caused by a coronavirus and will likely have a few viral fragments matching those of the cousin SARS-CoV-2 virus (8)  Testing healthy asymptomatic individuals is non-sensical, unscientific and a colossal waste of money.  Antibody testing is not the gold standard as many people have T-cell immunity, and antibodies may not circulate following recovery from infection.  Viral RNA detection by PCR does not equate to infectiousness or viable virus — PCR testings are scientifically meaningless because it is not a diagnostic tool, so why keep testing and testing people?

Surprised there are Singaporeans do not appreciate the hard work the government and the civil service peoples have done to secure the vaccines early for us. There is always risk in everything. Even when you walk out of your home there is too. We can pray to God for blessing but in reality we still need medical treatment for illness. I am surprised there are many medical experts here claiming all kinds of risks from the vaccines. There is side effects on any medical treatment whether taking a pill or having an operation. I am confident our MOH will not approve any medical treatment that will harm us. Anyway the cabinet will be taking the vaccines first before offering to Singaporeans. If there is any risk they will be the ones to get it first. So let's have faith and trust in our MOH. But please do not politicise this.

"Vaccinating the whole world's population to stamp out this virus is a huge task. 7b shots of the vaccines.  Slow economic recovery or could be more a case of disturbing uncertainty that is prolonged with no clear direction or focus. So long as this virus is alive on earth among human beings, no place is safe. . ....................... Mask-wearing and safe distancing ….do we see the bigger picture to prevent community transmission of the virus?  The vaccine is not a cure but a preventive measure.Will red dot encourage the UN and the WHO to do this: the UN and WHO should get all countries to cooperate and shut down for 40 days and 40 nights to stamp out COVID-19?  The best of time is now for the countries in the northern hemisphere during this wintry period [Christmas, New Year 2021, and the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays] to shut down for 40 days [like in the olden days of the leprosy infection to quarantine the new arrivals until the all-clear signal to let them out].Now is the time to do just that for the all-clear of infected persons to stamp out COVID-19 and force it to have a natural ending.  As for all other countries, those at the equator and those in the southern hemisphere [summer time], all should unite and comply to shut down too for 40s day to stamp out this disease well and good. Can the UN and WHO obtain this universal cooperation by all countries around the world to shut down this earth for 40 days and 40 nights at the same time? Time for the whole world to go into hibernation for 40 days. If we don’t, do we want to continue with the madness for another 400 or more days worldwide affecting the economy and all aspects of human lives? Choose wisely to have a suffering of 40 or 400 days physically, mentally, economically and socially, or do we want more than 400?",22/12/20,1.0,facebook

"Don't be afraid of Covid--19 vaccine. They won't harm you. Don't hear stupid hoaxes that it would harm you, that you're a guinea pig, that there's not much test done on Covid--19 vaccination. Stop spreading misleading news & don't panic with unfounded hoaxes. Covid-19 vaccination  help prevent the virus from spreading. There's new vaccines coming out & they were already tested on volunteers. Rule is all vaccines must always go on clinical trial test first before the vaccine be out. Which explain why you recently hear the news mentioned there's 3 different kinds of vaccines (different manufacturers) will be out soon .. the news mentioned 96 percent or 93 percent success rate & they still testing it further.  Any vacccines need thousands paid volunteers before the vaccine be out ...those volunteers are the real guinea pig not you.

"Phase 3 in Singapore will not open until end 2020 or January 2021 despite the fact that there are no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 infection. However, the Changi airport had openly welcome people from India, Indonesia...... despite the fact that there has been daily imported cases, mostly detected upon arrival, what is the risk to Singaporeans? are they on stay-at home quarantine or centralise restricted containment areas, what about those on the same trip with those infected but no symptoms? I agree that SIA and the airport must survive which is why SIA is now so gracious to attracting Singaporeans than foreign visitors, with so many innovations, dinners on board planes, sales of liquors, tours etc.. Will appreciate that the task force will continue to give briefings/updates on a periodic basis till there is no more cases of infection, and especially on the situation of imported cases and pro-active actions taken to prevent the spread from imported cases into the local community.",13/11/20,1.0,facebook

"Speech by SMS Lam -  31.          I am glad to update that the Integrated Youth Service will be starting in Woodlands this year.  Care Corner will reach out to youths at-risk and raise awareness on mental well-being and resilience. They will also provide individualised emotional support, needs identification and peer support services, and refer those who require further intervention to appropriate health and social services.  32.          Moving forward, we will continue to take a whole-of-society approach and work with other ministries to address youth mental health needs. This includes MOE, the Ministry for Social and Family Development (MSF), and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY), including their National Youth Council (NYC), on the recently announced Youth Mental Well-being Network.  > I'm fine with the IMH offshoot located outside of IMH, but what are the details to the IYS such that it does not become another stigma-spot?

"Speech by Minister Gan -  7.         Ms Sylvia Lim asked about using blood plasma for treatment. We are indeed planning to do so and NCID is collecting blood plasma from patients, but there are limitations and constraints. It may take some time before effective treatments and vaccines become available. As the global situation evolves, many countries may become infected. It will become increasingly difficult to stop the virus at our borders as we cannot ban visitors from every country and shut ourselves out from the world.  > Can there be more details on the ""limitations and constraints""? My sense is that you are saying immune cells isolation and monoclonal lab reproduction will not be in time to treat the currently critically ill, so how about the sourcing of suitable donor for wholesale transfusion as last resort, in which case you might have to open the call for local self-suspected subclinical cases or foreign authorities? I mean, MOH might as well make the open call as part of a comprehensive epidemiological study.",5/3/20,1.0,facebook
