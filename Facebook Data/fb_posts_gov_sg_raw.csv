I was at the Outram Polyclinic this afternoon to get my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The process was quick, simple and not painful at all. I also talked to several seniors who had received their jabs and they gave the same feedback. They shared that it was easy to register either at the community centre or online.

I want to encourage our seniors to quickly go for their vaccinations to protect themselves as older people are more vulnerable to COVID-19. I hope that family members will assist their parents and grandparents to go for their jabs.

The Government has made vaccinations free and very accessible with vaccination centres located near people‚Äôs homes and polyclinics, and it only requires a little effort from ourselves. Let‚Äôs together build a stronger immunity for ourselves.

Lee Hsien Loong is at Singapore General Hospital.
8 January at 12:40 ¬∑ Singapore ¬∑

Got my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine today, together with Director of Medical Services A/Prof Kenneth Mak. We got vaccinated early to show Singaporeans we are confident that the vaccine is safe and effective.

Prof Mak and I were monitored for 30 minutes after the jab, just in case we developed any side effects, e.g. allergic reactions. Happy to report that we both felt fine.

Today we started vaccinating healthcare workers from public healthcare institutions. We aim to start vaccinating elderly people from February, and then other Singaporeans and long-term residents.

Vaccinations are voluntary, but I hope that when it‚Äôs your turn, you will go for it. It will be free, it will protect you and your family, and it will help keep everyone safe. ‚Äì LHL

Lee Hsien Loong posted a video to the playlist Speeches.
18 December 2020 at 11:01 ¬∑

The COVID-19 outbreak in our migrant workers dorms took a tremendous combined effort ‚Äì by government agencies, healthcare workers, dorm operators, private sector organisations, and not least the workers themselves ‚Äì to bring under control. The situation is now stabilised and I‚Äôm happy to see that all our migrant workers are healthy and safe.

Today is International Migrants Day, an apt reminder to thank migrant workers for their contributions to our nation. You have endured a difficult period. As we enter Phase 3, more restrictions will be eased, and workers will be able to enjoy more communal activities. Workers will also be offered the vaccine, with more details to be announced.

We will continue to care for our migrant workers, just as we care for Singaporeans. Let us continue to work together to keep one another safe.

16 December 2020 at 13:56 ¬∑

2020 has been a tough year, and the economic impact of COVID-19 will likely be felt for some time to come. We are introducing the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (CRG) in January next year, to provide targeted support to lower- to middle-income employees and self-employed persons who are financially impacted by COVID-19, and have lesser financial means and family support, while they search for new jobs or training opportunities.

Applications will open on 18 Jan 2021. Successful applicants will receive up to $700 (for job loss or involuntary no-pay-leave) or $500 (for income loss) per month for 3 months.

Learn more about the CRG through these infographics or visit go.gov.sg/CRG. Please share this with someone who may benefit from the Grant.

[Flying our National Flag üá∏üá¨]

There are few sights as stirring and revealing of our national pride and solidarity as the display of the Singapore flag outside our homes. It‚Äôs an expression of love and a symbol of our national values (plus, a reminder that National Day is approaching!)

There‚Äôs been some concern raised after certain media reported that those who continue to fly the flags after Sep 30 will be fined. Let me assure you: as far as I know, no one has ever been fined for this, nor do we plan to do so.

But in cases of deliberate disrespect against the flag in any way, we will of course take action. These rules are meant to safeguard the dignity of our flag. There‚Äôs no reason to ‚Äúpunish‚Äù those who treat it with respect and dignity, and are proud to showcase the Singapore spirit. Patriotism is not just a right, it‚Äôs simply right.

The Singapore Arms and Flag and National Anthem (‚ÄúSAFNA‚Äù) Act which governs the use of the national flag has been in place since 1959. We amended the legislation in 2007 to allow us to display it from our homes from 1 Jul to 30 Sep - and following public feedback, did a one-time extension this year to start from 25 April as a unifying symbol during COVID-19.

Unrelated to the recent news, MCCY had already initiated a review of SAFNA to look at a number of issues, including to allow more occasions on which our flags can be displayed, while always protecting its dignity from extended display or neglect. Please share your suggestions on how we can continue to use the flag to express our pride and identity at https://go.gov.sg/singaporeflag.

Singaporeans have shown incredible grit and resilience during this testing period. While the Singapore flag remains a symbol of everything we stand for, I ask that you also never, ever wave a white flag when it comes to standing up for our nation and fellow Singaporeans.

As of 5 Aug 2020, 12pm, MOH has preliminarily confirmed an additional 908 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore.

Of these, the vast majority are dormitory residents who were tested during their isolation/quarantine period, even though they are asymptomatic. They are amongst the final batch of workers being cleared and they come from dormitories with a relatively high prevalence of COVID-19. Hence MOH expects the daily case counts to be high for the coming days, before tapering down thereafter as the Inter-agency Taskforce completes the dormitory clearance.

MOH remains on track to clear all the dormitories by 7 August, except for a few standalone blocks in the dormitories that serve as quarantine facilities. There are presently about 9,700 workers in these quarantine facilities. They will have to serve out their 14-day isolation periods, and be subject to an exit test before they are able to resume work.",5/8/2020 19:31,,,,,212,9,0,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158666597903686,[]

Misinformation can spread faster than a virus in an outbreak. To combat fake news amidst COVID-19, Singapore leverages technology to disseminate accurate information in an innovative and efficient way. Official government channels like Gov.sg's Whatsapp and Telegram deliver latest news updates right into the hands of Singaporeans, while web portals, such as Urban Redevelopment Authority's SpaceOut and GovTech (Government Technology Agency of Singapore)'s MaskGoWhere and FluGoWhere, provide timely information on key COVID-19 initiatives.

Beyond these efforts, Singapore also tapped on AI technologies to gather essential information crucial to the fight against COVID-19.

The Ministry of Manpower is aware of a video circulating online, on migrant workers gathering at S11 Dormitory on Sunday, 5 July 2020.

The migrant workers who gathered were dormitory residents who are residing in a cleared block for recovered workers.

On that day, the dormitory operator was re-assigning rooms in the block, to group workers based on their employers and worksites, as part of the Safe Living measures that dormitory operators must implement. The measures are to reduce the risks of reinfection of COVID-19, and to enable migrant workers to return to work safely.

The initial instructions from the dormitory operator had caused some confusion amongst the migrant worker residents, which led to them gathering at the common area. The dormitory operator immediately tried to resolve the situation, and was able to disperse the gathering within 30 minutes. All the residents involved were wearing masks.

He emphasised that face shields should only be worn in some situations where the wearing of masks may not be practical.

Such examples include:
- Children, 12 years and below, who have difficulty wearing masks, or keeping a face mask on for prolonged periods of time.
- People who have health conditions that may result in breathing difficulties or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for prolonged periods of time.
- People who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture style setting where they are largely remaining in a single spot from which they are speaking and are able to maintain a safe distance away from others.

Face shields worn on top of a mask can also provide some additional protection to prevent the masks from getting wet and minimise people touching their face. However, masks will continue to be the default situation for all.

It has been more than 30 days since the circuit breaker began. More than a month ago, I was still working at a studio, going to the hawker centre to have kopi-o-siu-dai and wanton mee with my studio-mate. Today, dining out is out, the playground is closed, and masking tape is everywhere for social-distancing measures.

It is a challenging time as we cope with the new norms that would likely persist beyond the circuit breaker. Most of us are staying at home. Working and learning form home and coping with it in our ways: cooking, music, art, yoga, writing or plenty of Studio Ghibli films. Some are going beyond by volunteering, promoting social awareness, raising charity funds to help the less fortunate, the migrant workers, and the elderly.

Behind the scenes, there is a whole system and team of people working to keep Singapore running so that we could stay at home, taking care of our loved ones and working with peace of mind: deliverymen who could bring a little comfort like mee chiang kueh from Ghim Moh or bubble tea. Supermarket workers who stock the shelves with pasta sauces or vegetables. On the front lines, medical personnel, the SAF and first-responders and volunteers are keeping our daily situation in check as the pandemic continues to develop globally.

The work is a homage to the ongoing efforts against Covid-19 from people from all walks of life.

We are all in this together. Stay strong, stay healthy, stay sane and stay safe!

Test methods will comprise PCR and serology testing to detect both currently infected workers, as well as those who have recovered from COVID-19. This helps to clear affected dorms thoroughly of the infection.

At the same time, he noted that many currently infected workers are recovering well, with an estimated 20,000 workers set to be discharged by the end of May. This will put Singapore in a favourable position to begin taking steps to reopen the economy in a cautious and calibrated manner.

MINDEF clarifies errors in a Facebook post by the Singapore States Times.

Clarifications Regarding Infections in Expo CCF Published by Singapore States Times on 6 May 2020 of an NSF Infected with #COVID19

MINDEF refers to the 6 May 2020 Facebook post by the Singapore States Times, on infections among staff at the Community Care Facility (CCF) at Singapore Expo. That post contained a number of errors. There has been no reported case of infections among staff under the SAF deployed to take care of COVID-19 patients at the Expo. The 20-year-old male Singaporean citizen cited by the post, who was confirmed by the Ministry of Health in their News Release (5 May 2020) to be COVID-19-positive, works under a different healthcare group. Neither is he a Full-Time National Serviceman (NSF), as claimed by the post, but a trained nurse from a private agency. The Singapore States Times also claimed that none of the national servicemen deployed by the SAF at the CCF had any experience in the hospitals. This is again wrong. Some of them are doctors and medics with prior hospital experience.

The SAF recognises the inherent risk to all its staff deployed in the CCF to care for recovering COVID-19 patients. Careful attention had been paid to the training and preparation of all staff to institute and maintain protocols to protect themselves against infection. These protocols are emphasised repeatedly. Nonetheless, as with all healthcare and administrative workers on the frontlines against COVID-19, risks of infections are continually present. The SAF will step up its vigilance and do its utmost to prevent such infections.

Given its history of repeatedly communicating multiple falsehoods, the Singapore States Times‚Äô Facebook page has been designated as a Declared Online Location by the Ministry of Communications and Information, with effect from 7 May 2020.

<<Supporting Singaporeans during crisis>>

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit many Singaporeans hard. For those who are affected financially, we want to provide support.

We have received more than 500,000 applications for the Temporary Relief Fund, and applications have closed. The TRF provided interim assistance for those affected by COVID-19‚Äôs economic impact, until schemes like the COVID-19 Support Grant and the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) come into effect.

We recognise that Singaporeans may need more support after this month. That is why we have decided to enhance the COVID-19 Support Grant when applications open from May to 30 Sep 2020.

When we first announced the Grant, it was intended to support local employees who have lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 situation. Now, it will be extended to support:

a. Employees placed on involuntary No-Pay Leave (NPL) for at least 3 consecutive months, and

b. Employees who have had sustained salary reduction of at least 30% for 3 consecutive months.

Those who have lost their jobs, or are placed on No-Pay Leave for at least 3 months, may receive up to $800 a month for 3 months. Those who have lost their jobs can also receive employment and training support from Workforce Singapore (WSG) or Employment and Employability Institute (e2i). Others on involuntary NPL will have access to relevant courses subsidised by SkillsFuture Singapore. You may apply for the Grant from Monday, 4 May.

Those who have had their monthly salaries reduced by 30% or more for 3 months may receive up to $500 a month for 3 months. You may apply for the Grant from Monday 11 May.

We encourage you to apply online at go.gov.sg/CSG (goes ‚Äòlive‚Äô only from 4 May) with your supporting documents. You can email Ask_SSO@msf.gov.sg or call the ComCare hotline at 1800-222-0000 if you require assistance to apply online. If you are unable to email or call, you can approach your nearest SSO (go.gov.sg/ssolocator) for help with the online application.

Do note that full-time National Servicemen, interns, and self-employed persons such as taxi or private-hire drivers, insurance agents and delivery persons are not eligible for the COVID-19 Support Grant. Self-employed persons may be assisted under the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (www.ntuc.com.sg/sirs/).

We are also proactively helping existing ComCare clients. If your ComCare assistance is ending between now and July 2020, we will extend your assistance for a further 6 months without the need for further review. Families on ComCare whose circumstances have worsened during the COVID-19 situation may approach SSOs to review and possibly increase your current level of ComCare support.

New ComCare clients will also generally receive at least six months of assistance.

With the enhanced COVID-19 Support Grant and proactive ComCare assistance, my colleagues and I want to give you and your families more support as you seek new employment and training opportunities during this crisis.

Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (Muis)
25 April 2020 at 14:00 ¬∑

An article alleging questionable practices in Singapore halal certification process is being circulated online.

We would like to clarify and debunk the allegations made in the article.

Muis manages the process of halal certification in Singapore based on the highest standards of governance, as expected of the Singapore Public Service. All processes are ISO 17065 certified throughout all stages of application, and key decisions on halal certification are made by an independent panel in Muis.

Muis applies the same rigour in determining whether to recognise foreign Halal certifying bodies (FCBs). While Muis recognises that FCBs operate in different social, religious and legal contexts from Singapore, Muis only recognises those who are able to demonstrate that they adhere to similar standards adopted by Muis, as well as the clearly stipulated terms and conditions for recognition. This includes organisational governance and competence as well as compatibility in religious standards and guidelines.

No one single individual, within or outside Muis, can influence the outcome of any application in any way. Muis places the utmost priority in ensuring the integrity of its Halal Quality Management System, to provide assurance and confidence to consumers.

Muis takes a serious view of such misleading reporting. Muis is looking into the matter and considering taking action against the publishers of the article. We would like to urge the community not to circulate unverified claims, and to approach the proper authorities if in doubt.

He noted that unlinked cases still remain, although the number of cases within the community has declined since the start of the measures. This indicated a continued seeding of the virus within the community.

He emphasised the need to put in extra effort in safe distancing, so that Singapore can break the transmission of COVID-19, especially with the vulnerable groups, such as our seniors and older workers.

In the first prong, dormitories with existing clusters will be locked down and the movement of workers within the dormitories will be restricted. In the second prong, these safety distancing measures will also be applied to dormitories with no clusters to further prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infection. Lastly, workers in essential services have been placed in separate housing facilities instead of dormitories and have undergone medical screenings to ensure that they did not have symptoms before moving into alternative accommodation.

Desmond Lee

We have received many queries from good-hearted charities, social service agencies and ground-up groups whether they can continue community service outreach during the Circuit Breaker.

During this period, we want to ensure that vulnerable people continue to get essential support. At the same time, all of us need to stay home, reduce our social interactions to the minimum, and go out when absolutely necessary. Only then can we reduce the spread of COVID-19.

To strike a sensible balance, charities, social service agencies and ground-up groups can approach the National Council of Social Service if they need their activities that provide essential aid, such as food and financial support, to be whitelisted. NCSS will coordinate and work with you to ensure that our vulnerable get support during the Circuit Breaker, while ensuring that they are kept safe and your volunteers and staff achieve stringent safe distancing. Some activities must continue, others can be modified or temporarily suspended.

Meanwhile, essential social services by MSF (e.g. our SSOs, residential homes, designated community services providing critical care) will continue to serve our most vulnerable among us.

Let's work together to help our most vulnerable get through this crisis. If you come across someone in the community who needs assistance, please contact the ComCare Hotline at 1800-222-0000.

Reaching out to Singaporeans in more ways than one.

In a situation like this COVID-19 outbreak, we need to broaden access to information across as many platforms as possible to reach everyone with reliable, clear and timely information.

We have been doing our best to keep you informed about the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation through many platforms - digitally, like Gov.sg website, Gov.sg WhatsApp, Telegram and Twitter, and traditionally, through newspaper and television ads.

To complement these efforts, we are now launching the COVID-19 Info Bot, that will give you quick answers to topical questions and concerns. The COVID-19 Info Bot is accessible on the Gov.sg website or by visiting www.gov.sg/infobot, and will help you navigate through all the information.

The information on this Info Bot is tailored to specific groups ‚Äì for students, parents, businesses and employers, and workers. It will carry summarised information relating to COVID-19 from various government agencies, ranging from mask distribution, home-based learning for students, workplace closures, advisories on good hygiene practices, being socially responsible and more!

Share this COVID-19 Info Bot with your loved ones and friends.

You must have seen several posts being circulated online on the catered food being distributed to the foreign workers residing at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas.

Some of the posts claimed that the food was substandard and inedible.

Over the last few days, MOM has been working with multiple professional caterers to progressively improve on the quality of the food, as well as to tailor to the different dietary requirements and preferences of the resident workers. And we will continue to make improvements along the way.

Here, you can see photos of the dinner we catered for the resident workers at Toh Guan Dormitory yesterday evening. The MOM team interviewed some resident workers on what they thought of the food too.

When the COVID-19 outbreak began, A*STAR tasked our researchers and engineers to channel their focus towards coming up with innovations that would contribute to Singapore‚Äôs fight against #COVID19.

These have included work on diagnostic test kits, therapeutics, in-silico modelling, and the employment of computer vision and deep learning to detect lung infection on chest x-rays, among others.

One ground-up initiative that has emerged is that of a DIY mask, the result of brainstorming from student researchers.

The DIY mask can be easily assembled using everyday items. This is timely, and will support the ongoing safe distancing measures.

FALSE MESSAGE CIRCULATING IN THE PUBLIC REGARDING DOOR-TO-DOOR DISTRIBUTION OF REUSABLE MASKS

There are false text and audio messages circulating via text messaging services, claiming that there are people robbing residents under the pretext of distributing masks, purportedly under a new government initiative. The message also claimed that the residents would be made to try on masks believed to be doused with chemicals which made them lose consciousness.

This is untrue. The Police have not received any report regarding such incidents.

The Police urge the public not to spread unsubstantiated information which may cause public alarm.

The Police take a very stern view against anyone who knowingly spreads false information to mislead the public and will not hesitate to take actions against such individuals.

There are no government initiatives to distribute masks directly to households. Instead, all residents with registered home addresses will be able to collect reusable masks at designated Community Clubs/Centres and Residents‚Äô Committees from 5 to 12 April 2020. Collection details are available on https://maskgowhere.sg.

Today, we visited Kopi So Coffeeshop at Hong Kah North SMC with Dr Amy Khor, Senior Minister of State for the Environment and Water Resources, to encourage patrons to keep 1 metre apart from others when queuing, and to sit on unmarked or alternate seats when dining in.

Spot the SG Clean Ambassadors in action in your neighbourhood!

And sign up to be an Ambassador at http://go.gov.sg/sgcleanambassadors

[Joint statement by the Singapore Tourism Board, Enterprise Singapore and Singapore Police Force]

Following yesterday‚Äôs announcement that all entertainment venues will be closed from 26 March, 2359 hours till 30 April, we are aware a number of nightlife operators intend to host ‚Äúfarewell‚Äù events tonight that could result in large numbers of people congregating. These events undermine the fight against COVID-19 and increases risk to public health. If you are planning to attend, we urge you to seriously reconsider, if not for your own health, then for the health of those around you.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce‚Äôs decision to enforce stricter safe distancing measures aims to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local COVID-19 clusters, which could strain our healthcare system further.

From now until the stricter measures kick in on 26 March 2020, 2359 hours, nightlife operators must continue to strictly implement safe distancing measures announced by the Ministry of Health on 20 March 2020. Events with 250 or more participants must be suspended, while operators of events with fewer than 250 participants must implement all necessary precautionary measures, including ensuring a distance of at least a metre between all participants and reduce mingling amongst participants.

These safe distancing measures are enforceable. Officers from government agencies including the Singapore Police Force will be on the ground to monitor the situation and carry out enforcement action over the next two days. The Traffic Police will also be conducting island-wide enforcement operations against drink-driving during this period. We will not hesitate to take action against anyone who fails to comply.

During this time, we appeal to Singaporeans to exercise good judgement and social responsibility. This will play an important part in keeping fellow Singaporeans and our loved ones safe in the midst of this global pandemic.",25/3/2020 14:32,,,,,176,17,40,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158214063088686,[]

Jawatankuasa Kerja Berbilang Kementerian (MTF) hari ini mengumumkan langkah-langkah ketat untuk memastikan jarak selamat dalam sebarang perhimpunan termasuk membataskan jumlah perhimpunan seramai 250 sahaja. Pemerintah perlu memperkenalkan langkah-langkah tambahan ini dengan serius untuk mengekang penularan virus COVID-19 di tengah-tengah peningkatan kes-kes baru khususnya yang diimport dari luar negara.

Selaras dengan langkah-langkah baru ini, Muis akan bekerja rapat dengan masjid-masjid untuk mengusahakan cara terbaik bagi melaksanakan jarak selamat di masjid-masjid, apabila kita beribadah dan sebagainya, sebelum masjid dibuka kepada para jemaah pada Jumaat depan, 27 Mac.

Muis juga akan mendapatkan bimbingan dari Jawatankuasa Fatwa bagi penyesuaian yang ingin diperkenalkan. Maklumat lanjut akan diumumkan minggu hadapan. Saya harap masyarakat dapat meneruskan sokongan padu dan kerjasama anda supaya kita terus mencegah Masjid daripada menjadi kelompok jangkitan COVID-19 dan memastikan Singapura selamat.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce on COVID-19 today announced stricter safe distancing measures to prevent further spread of the disease, especially among vulnerable segments of the population. This is in view of the pattern of transmission among the locally transmitted cases. Ministry of Health, Singapore found that the spread occurred during events at the workplace as well as social and religious gatherings. These safe distancing measures must be stepped up urgently in tandem with our parallel efforts to tighten our borders and to ring fence any infection clusters.

In line with the new measures, Muis will continue to work closely with our mosques to assess how we can operationalise safe distancing when our mosques open its doors to congregants next Friday, 27 March 2020.

The Fatwa committee will be consulted to guide us on the proposed adjustments that will need to be made to our prayer practices, in accordance with safe distancing requirements. More information will be available soon.

As the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve, I thank our community for your strong support and commitment to overcome this challenge together. I look forward to your understanding and strong support to ensure the safety of our mosques, our community and our fellow Singaporeans. Together, we can get through this!

Was at Changi Airport this afternoon to receive a very special cargo - more than 300,000 eggs meant for domestic consumption.

About a quarter of the eggs we consume are produced locally and a significant number come from Malaysia. However, we also have many other source countries which we have identified over the years and are able to activate them quickly when the need calls for it. This applies not just to eggs but other food products and essential items.

We managed to activate this option in a matter of two days and I would like to express my appreciation to Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR), the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), Singapore Airlines and SATS for helping us to bring the eggs in so quickly.

These efforts to secure and diversify our food supply have been developed and strengthened through the years. Even though we have a robust plan in place, we do not take it for granted and reassess it regularly to test its robustness against different scenarios. This is how things have always been done in Singapore and will continue to guide our approach to all issues, big and small, going forward. CCS

In order to further reduce the risk of importation of COVID-19 cases to Singapore, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced additional border restriction measures.

However, given our close proximity to Malaysia, the 14-day SHN will not apply to our land and sea crossings with Malaysia. Singaporean and Malaysian workers who commute between Singapore and Malaysia daily will still be able to do so. The latest restrictions will also not have an impact on the supply of food and other essentials between Singapore and Malaysia as drivers of goods vehicles will be able to enter as per normal.

These new measures are necessary to ensure that our healthcare system does not get overwhelmed by people entering Singapore for the sole purpose of seeking treatment in Singapore. We will continue to monitor the situation closely as it develops globally. CCS

Update to The Community: Day 3 of Mosque Closure

Assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh.

Last Thursday, Muis took the unprecedented step of closing our mosques for at least 5 days, to allow us to begin thoroughly disinfecting our mosques, as well as work with MOH to undertake contact tracing of the jemaah attending the large scale event in KL and their close contacts.

I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the community‚Äôs understanding for the need for the temporary closures of our beloved mosques and the adjustments and inconvenience we have had to bear as a result. This is a necessary precautionary measure, as we gather in mosques in large numbers every day, and especially so on Fridays.

I would like to add that we must take special care to protect our seniors in the community, as studies have shown that the mortality rate is much higher for those aged 60 and above who contract the virus.

Alhamdulillah, many Muslims have expressed support and understand it is our duty to protect the community and larger society.

MOH has since shared information that the infected individuals have been to 10 of our mosques since they returned from KL, and could have close contact with other jemaah in our mosques during this time when they were infectious. As such, we are issuing a public advisory with MOH to encourage persons who have been at the mosques during this time to take extra care and precaution.

The number of positive cases in Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei have also risen significantly over the past 2 days, among the returnees from the KL event.

In the last few days, there has also been news of some members of the community attending other large-scale religious gatherings overseas. We appeal to the community to avoid such events during this period.

In the meantime, the cleaning efforts in our mosques are proceeding smoothly. We are closely monitoring the developments, and will provide updates on the reopening of our mosques in due course.

Esa Masood
CE, Muis

[Budget 2020: Stabilising and Supporting our Economy in the Near-Term]

Under the $4 billion Stabilisation and Support Package, we will help our workers retain their jobs, and use any lull period to upgrade their skills, to be ready when the tide turns. We will also help our enterprises to continue transforming, and make sure that their workers benefit.

To help our workers stay employed, we will support enterprises for a part of their wage cost, through introducing a Jobs Support Scheme and enhancing the Wage Credit Scheme.

Some sectors are more directly impacted, including tourism, air transport, as well as related sectors like retail, food services, and land transport.

To help employers in these sectors retain and reskill workers, we will enhance support under the Adapt and Grow initiative, specifically through redeployment programmes in affected sectors.

Taken together with the Jobs Support Scheme, we will support employers to retain and train more than 330,000 workers in these affected sectors. They can make full use of the down time for training and upskilling, to prepare for the recovery.

Ministry of Trade & Industry, Singapore Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Transport, Singapore will share further details in due course.

Our immediate concern is to protect you and your families. We will put in every effort to slow down the spread of the virus.

Frontline ministries have been fighting and containing the outbreak. We will set aside an additional $800 million in this Budget to support these efforts, with the bulk of this going to the Ministry of Health, Singapore.

With these uncertainties, Singaporeans are worried about the impact on our business and jobs. Families are also concerned about rising expenditures.

To stabilise the economy and provide assurance to Singaporeans, we will introduce two packages, totalling $5.6 billion.

The first is the Stabilisation and Support Package for workers and enterprises.

The second is the Care and Support Package for households, to support our people through these uncertain times, and alleviate concerns over cost of living. More help will be given to the less well-off.

[Budget 2020: Responding to Challenges in a New Decade]

This year, we usher in a new decade ‚Äì one marked by tectonic shifts in our operating environment, and growing uncertainties.

Against this backdrop, Singapore‚Äôs economy grew by a modest 0.7% in 2019. This was the weakest growth since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis.

Just as the global economy was beginning to recover, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19 outbreak hit unexpectedly last month. This brings new uncertainties, felt across the world.

We have done so as there are now a few local cases without any links to previous cases or travel history to China. This is a scenario that we are prepared for and we will put in place additional measures to minimise the risk of further transmission.

MTI is in close contact with our retailers and I assure all Singaporeans that there is no need to rush for essential supplies like rice or instant noodles. Our supply lines for these essentials are intact and there is no risk of us running a shortage of essential food or household items. We also have our national stockpile for essential items.

However, we must all play our part, exercise individual responsibility and not hoard items unnecessarily. This will create undue panic and is unhelpful to the situation at hand.

Collective defence is our strongest defence. Let us all stay alert but remain calm and collected. The Government is monitoring all aspects of the situation closely and will always make sure that the needs of Singaporeans are met and catered for. CCS

<Masks for all Households; Use Responsibly>

We have sufficient masks in the national stockpile if everyone uses them responsibly. Responsible usage means following medical advice - only those who are sick need to wear masks; for those who are well, there is no need to wear masks.

Over the last 9 days, we released more than 5 million masks from the national stockpile to retailers. They were snapped up in hours. Yet many Singaporeans are still unable to get a mask. The current situation is clearly not sustainable.

This is why the Taskforce has decided to change our distribution method, as my colleague Chan Chun Sing and I announced this morning. First, we will prioritise the national stockpile of masks for essential services, namely our healthcare workers at the frontline. Second, for the general public we will release masks from the national stockpile directly to Singaporeans. In particular we will provide a packet of 4 masks each for every local household.

We are doing this to assure all Singaporeans that if any member of the family falls sick and needs a mask, they will have one at hand. But remember to use the masks responsibly. Do not wear the masks immediately. Keep this as a precaution and use the masks only if someone in the family falls sick and needs to go out to see the doctor.

I know many Singaporeans are concerned about the virus and want to protect themselves and their families. The best thing to do is to uphold good personal hygiene. Wash your hands regularly with soap; do not use your hands to touch your face; if you are sick, see a doctor and stay at home until you recover.

With individual and collective responsibility, we can maintain a strong defence against the virus, and overcome this together.",30/1/2020 15:22,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6,,,,198,61,39,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10158035302133686,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/83693805_3401194523255200_4076568153163825152_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=1oM7j5CZFhkAX8vp2ZQ&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=65a620a8f3d820a3f5065c8064279c27&oe=604D4EB6']"

WELCOME HOME!

SCOOT TR121 from Wuhan which touched down this morning at Changi is special. It carried the 92 Singaporeans who were stuck in Wuhan when PRC decided to lock down the city. You can imagine their anxiety and fear! Their ordeal is over, though we have to put them under quarantine for 14 days.

TR121 was made possible through the dedication and sacrifice of many agencies and colleagues. We thank the MFA officers who gallantly escorted the Singaporeans back! We thank the CAAS, CAG, ICA and MOH colleagues who worked through the days and nights! We thank the SCOOT pilots and crew members who made this flight possible! On behalf of the MOT family, thank you to all of you!

As always, we stand together to help our fellow Singaporeans. This was what we did 17 years ago, when Singaporeans came together to battle SARS. With the experience from SARS, we started our thermal scanning much earlier this time at all our air, sea and land checkpoints.

We will conquer this Wuhan Virus, like how we did as a nation 17 years ago.

In view of the first confirmed case in Singapore, MOH has put in additional precautionary measures to reduce the risk of importation of a new coronavirus to Singapore.

MOH advises Singaporeans to avoid travel to the whole of Hubei Province. Singaporeans who need to travel to the affected areas should regularly check MOH's website (www.moh.gov.sg) for updates.

Stay calm and vigilant, and remember to adopt good personal hygiene practices!

This year Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) has embarked on several initiatives to seek the views of Singaporeans on environmental challenges and co-create solutions. This included consulting the public and key stakeholders on our Zero Waste Masterplan, and convening our inaugural Citizens‚Äô Workgroup to improve household recycling.

The Citizens‚Äô Workgroup initiative brought together citizens of diverse backgrounds, and allowed us to tap on the strengths and experiences of our community to develop interesting solutions. Over the past weekend, the #RecycleRight Citizens' Workgroup presented some of its final ideas to Senior Minister of State Amy Khor. I am heartened to learn of the participants' commitment to the Workgroup. Many of them met up several times outside of the official sessions to discuss their projects.

It has been a meaningful and rewarding experience for my colleagues at MEWR and National Environment Agency (NEA). We will continue to work together with Singaporeans on our journey #TowardsZeroWaste.",23/10/2019 21:01,,,,,21,1,0,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10157729335438686,[]

58 Singaporeans came together for the first session of the Citizens‚Äô Panel on Work-Life Harmony today. It was initially intended to be a Panel of about 50 members, but due to the enthusiastic response from the public, we tried to accommodate more.

Everyone of us as citizens have an equal stake in Singapore. Everyone brings something different to the table. How do we make progress on the issues we care about? How can we shape a better future together? This is the essence of the SG Together movement, working with Singaporeans for Singaporeans. The Citizens‚Äô Panel is a relatively new way to foster such partnerships.

One area that Singaporeans care a lot about is families and we can achieve Work-Life Harmony. This is really about social norms ‚Äì what we say and do that is acceptable to each other. It‚Äôs an area where joint action by everyone in society is likely to produce better results.

Low Yen Ling, Assoc Prof Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and I, along with tripartite leaders, had a chance to interact with the Panel members, who come from all walks of life ‚Äì employers, employees, freelancers, homemakers, retirees. Despite the diverse backgrounds and perspectives, all of us want to make a difference, and collectively find a way forward for work-life harmony in Singapore. - Jo Teo",30/9/2019 18:39,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/71095434_3058479397559668_3023050767519973376_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=nu5-9XRN3MQAX_YwuK_&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=75fc61682874e71c3e403cc5325f2005&oe=604B2B11,,,,44,3,2,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10157658891868686,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/71095434_3058479397559668_3023050767519973376_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=nu5-9XRN3MQAX_YwuK_&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=75fc61682874e71c3e403cc5325f2005&oe=604B2B11', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/70886984_3058479420892999_443124416017072128_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=tgAZHWinLTIAX8nO1nX&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=d2fa9b41822d9701520ec106e20f1db5&oe=604C02B4', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/71214937_3058479494226325_6345433662917443584_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=eS8YypEFjKEAX9OUwB1&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=fa4aa7365e6a07975df422618299f94a&oe=604DB589', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/70919136_3058479567559651_8093575104321028096_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=vaKGGdUbhbIAX_7PfbL&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=be309f606e1c1fd7bdde2d9ec7dcbded&oe=604DEF01']"

And...this iconic building is indeed the Registry of Civil and Muslim Marriages! It is also known as the ROM & ROMM building. Students from SUTD, NP and TP were asked to re-imagine what the 36 year-old building can be. Drawing on Singaporeans' memories of the building, as well as their own thoughts about marriage, our youths have proven their creative talents with their works of art!

Come check out 7 of the designs at the Designing #MyFutureROM exhibition, happening from 23 Aug - 20 Sep at the ROM & ROMM building at 7 Canning Rise! Give your support to our budding designers and tell them what you like about their designs!

IMPROVING WORK-LIFE HARMONY, TOGETHER

Work and family responsibilities demand a lot of our time and energy. Many of us try to cope as best as we can.

It is therefore heartening whenever I learn of employers that have taken the effort to improve conditions for work-life harmony for its staff. I visited Grand Park City Hall, Singapore today and saw how they had measures in place to create a supportive environment for their staff, many of whom are working mothers and caregivers. All employees are given flexibility such as compressed work shifts, while non-frontline employees can also enjoy flexible start and end times. The hotel has even installed sleep capsules in the staff‚Äôs lounge, for those who need to catch a quick nap to recharge!

I chatted with a few staff. They are appreciative of the flexible-work arrangements in place. Davina, a first-time mother, opted to start and end work earlier on Fridays, so that she can head home and spend time with her four-month-old daughter and family. Nurhida, a mother of two, is able to start and end work by 5:30pm during fasting month, to break fast with her family.

What more can be done to improve the conditions that support Work-Life Harmony?

As it is an issue that‚Äôs close to all our hearts, I believe it would be meaningful to involve fellow Singaporeans in developing recommendations that support Work-Life Harmony. The Citizens‚Äô Panel on Work-Life Harmony will be an opportunity for us to shape a new consensus on helping Singaporeans to manage both their work and family commitments. I am happy to announce that applications to be part of the Panel opened today.

If you are keen to work together with fellow Singaporeans to develop solutions that support work-life harmony in #Singapore, please visit http://www.ideas.gov.sg/public/CitizensPanel_WorkLifeHarmony to register your interest. From that link, you can also find out more about what‚Äôs required of a Panel member. We look forward to getting your views, and working together with you on this very important issue of Work-Life Harmony. ‚Äì Jo Teo",16/7/2019 12:27,https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/66695115_2853928001348143_1605358728276606976_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=fDxCr7IxFzEAX-7ctq8&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e1160e3b7878d233d3788f1771097bce&oe=604E089A,,,,52,2,0,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10157463436738686,"['https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/66695115_2853928001348143_1605358728276606976_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=fDxCr7IxFzEAX-7ctq8&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=e1160e3b7878d233d3788f1771097bce&oe=604E089A', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/66810112_2853927994681477_409867182869053440_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=fcoqaJBj0DYAX9nytZc&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=0bf369652240640058660660380da311&oe=604DF8A8', 'https://scontent.fsin5-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/fr/cp0/e15/q65/66596385_2853928011348142_4434931239270481920_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=Ln1ehKZI9LUAX8YVWH0&_nc_oc=AQnLphVJkksqdWR6o1UnPSTKnRlsbn2g0zzQupn17TclR9E9uQHQD8OXTsmOYdJ6t7U&_nc_ht=scontent.fsin5-1.fna&tp=14&oh=62d2ae97735c0effbfc4a8ea00863a02&oe=604BDA6A']"

EMBRACING PARENTHOOD CELEBRATIONS

Being part of The People's Association‚Äôs Embracing PArenthoodcelebrations is always a lovely reminder of the joys of parenthood. Embracing PArenthood Celebrations is also a reminder that the community is behind every parent, and that we all want to see you succeed in your parenting journey.

I chatted with many couples and grandparents too. Daddies these days are very much more involved ‚Äì fantastic! Still, several third-time mothers left the biggest impression. One told me she was fortunate that even though she started late (after her PhD), she was able to conceive. Another already had two boys ‚Äì 6 and 8 years old ‚Äì but felt the need to spend more time with them. Hence, she moved to a job with more stable work hours. Although bonuses are smaller in her new role, she feels her life is more balanced and this also encouraged her to have a third child. There were two nurses ‚Äì one expectant mum who continues to work and is supported by her helper and mother, while another who stopped working full-time when her first-born was five. The latter decided to stay home partly because her husband travels a lot for his work. Although her three children keep her very busy, she intends to resume part-time work once her children start schooling.

Parenthood is hard work and it does involve sacrifice. But these women did not let it stop them, and are confident their careers can still grow. Of course, the support of their husbands, families, helpers and co-workers are also essential. So this morning‚Äôs event was to let these families know the community celebrates with them. Also, we want to better support families.

We have been working on three main areas to better support marriage and parenthood - housing, preschool and community and workplace support. We need the help of Singaporeans to play a part, and provide us with your views so that we can work on things that make a difference to you.

Take the survey, and share your views with us at Heybaby.sg/PlayAPart, and I would like to encourage everyone, in your various roles as a family member, friend, employer, or co-worker, to join us in creating an environment that makes marriage and parenthood achievable, enjoyable and celebrated.

Some of you may be interested to hear how much it cost to develop and maintain parking.sg.

The project received a 4-year funding of $1.96 million in Feb 2017. By using modern cloud services, we are able to keep the cost low. For those of you who are interested, here are some services used in our production system and the rough monthly costs:
~$5000 a month for cloud hosting and databases
~$300 a month for a Content Delivery Network which also provides DNS and DDOS protection
~$200 a month for a service that automatically tests and deploys our code
~$100 a month for service monitoring and alerts
~$30 a month for Customer Relationship Management system to respond to your feedback
~$40 a month for database backups
~$25 a month for the informational site you see at parking.sg

Instead of hiring an external vendor, Parking.sg was built in-house by the project team themselves. Various people on the project team helped out, but at any point there were at most 3 people working full time on it. This saved us a lot of money since we didn‚Äôt have extra project management overhead or procurement costs.

We are grateful for this opportunity to share more on the costing of the project and will share more when we open-source the project in the first half of this year. If you have any suggestions on how we can be more efficient, we would love to hear from you. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",20/3/2019 18:33,,,,,53,5,8,https://facebook.com/gov.sg/posts/10157160908783686,[]

Right-wing Australian senator blames ‚Äòimmigration‚Äô for New Zealand mosque attacks

[ Massacre in #NewZealand ]

NZ is a peaceful country. Seen as a model of race relations.

Today it suffered a horrific massacre of 49 innocent persons.

Carried out by a white man, ( apparently an Australian ) targeting Muslims in a mosque, in Christchurch.

He live-streamed his murderous assault.

He released an extreme, violent message just before his attack. He and two others have apparently been arrested.

Most people cannot imagine this happening in NZ.

Our prayers are with the victims and their families. It is heart breaking that people, praying in a mosque, should be mowed down.

Hours later, an Australian Senator, issued an Islamophobic Statement, describing Islam as a violent, fascist religion, and said it promoted savage beliefs. He also attacked the Prophet, and blamed Muslim immigration, for the massacre.

The Senator‚Äôs Statement is sickening. It is completely unacceptable. And he issued it when people are grieving.

In some parts of the world, there is open Islamophobia. Very sad.

Since 2013, the Better Internet Campaign by the Media Literacy Council has been promoting the safe and responsible use of digital technology. At the inaugural Better Internet Conference today, I launched this year‚Äôs Better Internet Campaign with the catchy tagline ‚Äì ‚ÄúBe Safe, Be Smart and Be Kind!‚Äù This tagline captures the key instincts we all need to nurture in the digital age: to be respectful in our online discourse, to be cautious in our online habits and to evaluate the veracity of the information we come across.

We can all be our very own best defenders against online falsehoods, when we arm ourselves with the knowledge and skills to do so. And this need not be difficult, especially when we come together as a nation ‚Äì individuals, industry, government and community, to help one another be the best online defender that we can be!

At Kueh Ho Jiak, the traditional ang ku kueh is given a makeover by young hawker Elizabeth and her mother. The mother and daughter duo did not come from a line of hawkers, they had to start from scratch. They went to learn the technicalities of the craft and tweaked them on the fly.

There is just so much love and passion poured into these handmade kuehs. Kueh Ho Jiak keeps the tradition alive and tweaked their craft to keep things relevant with the times. Read more: https://www.misstamchiak.com/kueh-ho-jiak-hawker-heritage/

[Greater Healthcare Assurance]

As more Singaporeans enter their senior years, healthcare needs will grow. Major changes have been made in healthcare to make it more affordable, accessible, and comprehensive.

Looking ahead, CHAS subsidies for GP clinics will be enhanced in three ways.
- First, CHAS will be extended to cover all Singaporeans for chronic conditions, regardless of income.
- Second, lower to middle-income Singaporeans who are CHAS Orange cardholders will also receive subsidies for common illnesses.
- Third, there will be increased subsidies for complex chronic conditions.

The Government will put $5.1 billion into a new Long-Term Care Support Fund, which will help fund the CareShield Life subsidies as well as other long-term care support measures, such as ElderFund.

For young Singaporeans, we invest heavily to provide a world-class education to bring out their best, regardless of starting point. We are spending more to enhance the accessibility, affordability, and quality of early childhood care and education.

This support continues throughout the schooling years, with the Government subsidising more than 90% of the total cost of education. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds get even more support through schemes such as KidSTART.

For the bottom 20 per cent of workers, the WIS scheme will be enhanced to provide better support.
- From January 2020, the qualifying income cap will be raised from the current $2,000 to $2,300 per month.
- The maximum annual pay-outs will also be increased by up to $400.

For older workers, we are doing more to help them earn more, save more, and have greater peace of mind in their retirement years. The Government will review the relevance and structure of the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and the Additional Special Employment Credit (ASEC). The SEC and ASEC will be extended another year, until the end of 2020.

#Factually

Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore - MPA
11 February 2019 at 18:40 ¬∑

#ICYMI There have been false online allegations about the collision between PIREAS and POLARIS on 9 Feb 2019.

Here are the facts:
1428hrs: PIREAS collided with POLARIS on its way from Singapore to Tanjung Pelepas. The incident was witnessed by PCG patrolling in the vicinity. PIREAS also reported its collision with POLARIS to MPA‚Äôs Port Operations Control Centre, and indicated that it had not sustained any damage.

1902hrs: After the facts had been established, MPA released a media statement, along with a photo of the incident.

1903hrs: The Straits Times posted the statement and carried the picture on its online site. It then followed up with a Facebook post at 1907hrs.

2000hrs: Videos of the collision were provided to the media.

As you can see, there is neither a ‚Äòchief culprit‚Äô nor an ‚Äòarranged‚Äô incident. MPA is investigating, and strongly urges the public to avoid spreading deliberate online falsehoods.

Do you recall how the Government has supported Singaporeans in the last few years?

The details can be found in the latest Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review, or SPOR. Published by the Ministry of Finance every two years, the Report is produced in collaboration with various agencies, and serves as Singapore‚Äôs ‚Äúreport card‚Äù, tracking the Government‚Äôs efforts in key areas, such as healthcare, transport, education, the economy, and national security.

#SPOR2018 provides an update on how the Government has performed through relevant indicators, such as the World Economic Forum‚Äôs Global Competitiveness Report, the workforce‚Äôs training participation rate, and the accessibility and affordability of healthcare services and housing.

Despite continuing global economic uncertainties, Singapore‚Äôs GDP is expected to grow by between 3.0% and 3.5% in 2018. Productivity in terms of real value added per actual hour worked has increased by over 3% from 2013 to 2017, and Singaporeans‚Äô wages have also increased.

Singapore imports most of our food. They come from diverse sources - 180 countries around the world.

Our Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) officers inspect these overseas farms and accredit them for food safety; and our importers ensure that the food comes in safely through a reliable supply chain.

Our own farms are also producing more food within Singapore. Many are adopting new techniques to increase their production and yield.
